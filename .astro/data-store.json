Asking questions and hoping for useful answers?\n\nI was too. And I was missing the point.\n\n## The Problem: AI Without Context\n\nLet me be honest: \u003CTooltip client:load content=\"Large Language Models - AI systems trained on massive amounts of text data to understand and generate human-like text\">ChatGPT, Claude, and other LLMs\u003C/Tooltip> are incredible. They can write code, explain complex topics, and help you think through problems. But there's a fundamental limitation that most people don't think about.\n\n**They know nothing about you.**\n\nThey don't know about your work. They don't know what meetings you have scheduled. They don't know what tasks are piling up on your to-do list. They don't know the codebase you're working on or the documents your team shares. They don't know about you.\n\nEvery company today has their own \"internal ChatGPT\". A wrapper with the company logo, integrated into Slack, answering questions about documentation...\n\nBut it only **answers**. And honestly? Not even that well — because it lacks your context. It doesn't **do** anything, and even when it tries to help, the answers are generic. Imagine an AI that not only answers *much better* because it knows your world, but also **acts** — and acts precisely.\n\n## The Shift: Context is King\n\nHere's what I've learned: the new way to use AI isn't about crafting better \u003CTooltip client:load content=\"Prompts are the instructions or questions you give to an AI. Prompt engineering is the practice of designing these instructions to get better outputs.\">prompts\u003C/Tooltip> or learning magic techniques. It's about giving AI access to your world.\n\nWhen AI has context about your environment — your emails, your calendar, your documents, your tools — something magical happens. It stops just *answering* and starts *acting*.\n\nInstead of asking \"How should I organize my emails?\" you can say \"Analyze my emails from today, summarize the important ones, and create tasks for anything that requires action.\"\n\nAnd it just... does it.\n\n\u003CBeforeAfterCompare \n  before={{\n    title: \"AI Without Context\",\n    description: \"Generic answers that apply to anyone\",\n    items: [\n      \"Copy-paste information manually\",\n      \"Adapt generic answers to your situation\",\n      \"Do the actual work yourself\",\n      \"AI as 'fancy autocomplete'\"\n    ]\n  }}\n  after={{\n    title: \"AI With Context\",\n    description: \"Personalized actions based on your world\",\n    items: [\n      \"AI understands your environment\",\n      \"Receives specific, actionable responses\",\n      \"Automates real tasks end-to-end\",\n      \"AI as true assistant\"\n    ]\n  }}\n/>\n\n## MCP: The Protocol Making This Possible\n\nIf you haven't heard about \u003CTooltip client:load content=\"Model Context Protocol - An open standard created by Anthropic that allows AI models to connect to external tools and data sources through a universal interface.\">MCP (Model Context Protocol)\u003C/Tooltip>, it's worth understanding. In simple terms, MCP is a standard way to connect AI models to external tools and data sources.\n\nThink about it: before MCP, every integration was custom. Want Claude to access your database? Write a plugin. Want it to send emails? Another plugin. Each one with its own API, authentication, data format.\n\nMCP standardizes all of this.\n\n\u003CFlowTimeline\n  title=\"How MCP Works\"\n  steps={[\n    { \n      title: \"1. Connection\", \n      description: \"The client connects to the MCP Server via SSE (Server-Sent Events) or stdio.\",\n      icon: \"🔌\"\n    },\n    { \n      title: \"2.

You just pass the list of available tools and it automatically chooses based on the conversation context.\n\nIn practice:\n- **Connect Gmail** → AI can read, search, summarize, and send your emails\n- **Connect Calendar** → AI can check availability, schedule meetings, and block time\n- **Connect Notion** → AI can create pages, update databases, and organize your notes\n- **Connect GitHub** → AI can review PRs, create issues, and check build status\n\nThink of it as a universal adapter. Instead of building custom integrations for every AI tool, MCP provides a common language. Any MCP-compatible client (like \u003CTooltip client:load content=\"Cursor is an AI-powered code editor that integrates AI directly into the development workflow. Claude Desktop is Anthropic's official desktop application for interacting with Claude.\">Cursor, Claude Desktop\u003C/Tooltip>, or custom agents) can connect to any MCP server and use its capabilities.\n\n> If you want to dive deeper into MCP, check out the [official documentation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) and the [Anthropic announcement](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol).\n\n## TrampoAI: From Theory to Practice\n\nTo understand how this works in practice, I built [TrampoAI](https://github.com/viniciusventura29/TrampoAI) — a complete MCP client with a chat interface.\n\n### Architecture\n\n```\n┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐\n│   React     │────▶│   Express   │────▶│   MCP Servers   │\n│   (Vite)    │◀────│   Backend   │◀────│   (via SSE)     │\n└─────────────┘     └──────┬──────┘     └─────────────────┘\n                           │\n                           ▼\n                    ┌─────────────┐\n                    │  Anthropic  │\n                    │    API      │\n                    └─────────────┘\n```\n\nThe flow is simple:\n\n1. **Frontend** sends a message to the backend\n2. **Backend** collects tools from all connected MCP Servers\n3. **Backend** sends message + tools to Anthropic API\n4. **Claude** responds with `tool_use` if it needs to execute something\n5. **Backend** executes the tool on the corresponding MCP Server\n6. **Backend** sends the `tool_result` back to Claude\n7. **Claude** generates the final response\n\n### Stack\n\n\u003Cdiv style=\"display: grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr); gap: 1rem; margin: 2rem 0;\">\n  \u003Cdiv style=\"padding: 1rem; background: #F5F2ED; border: 1px solid #2D3D3F;\">\n    \u003Cdiv style=\"font-family: 'IBM Plex Mono', monospace; font-size: 0.65rem; color: #5A5A5A; letter-spacing: 0.15em; margin-bottom: 0.25rem;\">FRONTEND\u003C/div>\n    \u003Cdiv style=\"font-family: 'IBM Plex Mono', monospace; font-size: 0.85rem; color: #0D5C4B; font-weight: 500;\">React 18 + Vite + TypeScript\u003C/div>\n  \u003C/div>\n  \u003Cdiv style=\"padding: 1rem; background: #F5F2ED; border: 1px solid #2D3D3F;\">\n    \u003Cdiv style=\"font-family: 'IBM Plex Mono', monospace; font-size: 0.65rem; color: #5A5A5A; letter-spacing: 0.15em; margin-bottom: 0.25rem;\">BACKEND\u003C/div>\n    \u003Cdiv style=\"font-family: 'IBM Plex Mono', monospace; font-size: 0.85rem; color: #0D5C4B; font-weight: 500;\">Express + TypeScript\u003C/div>\n  \u003C/div>\n  \u003Cdiv style=\"padding: 1rem; background: #F5F2ED; border: 1px solid #2D3D3F;\">\n    \u003Cdiv style=\"font-family: 'IBM Plex Mono', monospace; font-size: 0.65rem; color: #5A5A5A; letter-spacing: 0.15em; margin-bottom: 0.25rem;\">MCP SDK\u003C/div>\n    \u003Cdiv style=\"font-family: 'IBM Plex Mono', monospace; font-size: 0.85rem; color: #0D5C4B; font-weight: 500;\">@modelcontextprotocol/sdk\u003C/div>\n  \u003C/div>\n  \u003Cdiv style=\"padding: 1rem; background: #F5F2ED; border: 1px solid #2D3D3F;\">\n    \u003Cdiv style=\"font-family: 'IBM Plex Mono', monospace; font-size: 0.65rem; color: #5A5A5A; letter-spacing: 0.15em; margin-bottom: 0.25rem;\">LLM\u003C/div>\n    \u003Cdiv style=\"font-family: 'IBM Plex Mono', monospace; font-size: 0.85rem; color: #0D5C4B; font-weight: 500;\">Claude Sonnet 4\u003C/div>\n  \u003C/div>\n  \u003Cdiv style=\"padding: 1rem; background: #F5F2ED; border: 1px solid #2D3D3F;\">\n    \u003Cdiv style=\"font-family: 'IBM Plex Mono', monospace; font-size: 0.65rem; color: #5A5A5A; letter-spacing: 0.15em; margin-bottom: 0.25rem;\">STYLING\u003C/div>\n    \u003Cdiv style=\"font-family: 'IBM Plex Mono', monospace; font-size: 0.85rem; color: #0D5C4B; font-weight: 500;\">Tailwind CSS\u003C/div>\n  \u003C/div>\n  \u003Cdiv style=\"padding: 1rem; background: #F5F2ED; border: 1px solid #2D3D3F;\">\n    \u003Cdiv style=\"font-family: 'IBM Plex Mono', monospace; font-size: 0.65rem; color: #5A5A5A; letter-spacing: 0.15em; margin-bottom: 0.25rem;\">ICONS\u003C/div>\n    \u003Cdiv style=\"font-family: 'IBM Plex Mono', monospace; font-size: 0.85rem; color: #0D5C4B; font-weight: 500;\">Lucide Icons\u003C/div>\n  \u003C/div>\n\u003C/div>\n\n### Demo: One Prompt, Four Tools\n\nHere's TrampoAI in action. I connected three services:\n\n\u003CNetworkMesh \n  title=\"My Connected Services\"\n  user={{ label: \"You\", icon: \"👤\" }}\n  agent={{ label: \"AI Agent\", icon: \"🤖\" }}\n  gateway={{ label: \"MCP Gateway\", icon: \"🔗\" }}\n  mcps={[\n    { id: \"gmail\", label: \"Gmail\", icon: \"📧\" },\n    { id: \"notion\", label: \"Notion\", icon: \"📝\" },\n    { id: \"calendar\", label: \"Calendar\", icon: \"📅\" }\n  ]}\n/>\n\nThen I asked something like this:\n\n> *\"Read my last 10 emails, summarize them, find the ones I need to take action on, create tasks in Notion, and block 1 hour at 3pm today on my calendar to work on them.\"*\n\nWatch what happens:\n\n\u003Cvideo \n  controls \n  playsinline\n  preload=\"metadata\"\n  style=\"width: 100%; border: 1px solid #2D3D3F; margin: 2rem 0;\"\n  poster=\"/blogg/trampoai/trampoAiWallpaper.jpg\"\n>\n  \u003Csource src=\"/blogg/trampoai/demoVideo.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\" />\n  Your browser does not support video playback.\n\u003C/video>\n\nWith **one prompt**, Claude automatically:\n1. Called the **Gmail MCP** to read my emails\n2. Summarized and filtered which ones needed action\n3. Called the **Notion MCP** to create tasks\n4. Called the **Google Calendar MCP** to block time\n\nNo manual orchestration. No hardcoded workflows. The LLM figured out which tools to use and in what order.\n\nThis is the difference between AI that *informs* and AI that *acts*. I didn't ask for information. I asked for action. And because the AI had context about my email, my calendar, and my task management system, it could actually deliver.\n\n## The Scaling Problem: MCP Mess\n\nOk, it works. But what happens when you have **10 MCP Servers**? **50**? **100**?\n\n\u003CBeforeAfterCompare\n  before={{\n    title: \"Naive MCP\",\n    description: \"Each client connects to each MCP Server\",\n    items: [\n      \"N clients × M servers = N×M connections\",\n      \"Each client manages its own credentials\",\n      \"No centralized access control\",\n      \"No unified observability\"\n    ]\n  }}\n  after={{\n    title: \"The Problem\",\n    description: \"This doesn't scale\",\n    items: [\n      \"Connection explosion\",\n      \"Scattered credentials\",\n      \"Who accessed what?\",\n      \"How much are we spending?\"\n    ]\n  }}\n/>\n\nBuilding TrampoAI, I realized in practice: **managing multiple MCP Servers is a nightmare**.\n\nEach server has its own connection, its own tools, its own credentials. There's no way to know who executed what, how much it cost, if someone is abusing the system.\n\n## The Solution: MCP Mesh\n\nThis is where [Deco's MCP Mesh](https://www.decocms.com/mesh) comes in.\n\nThe idea is simple: instead of each client connecting directly to each MCP Server, you have a **control plane** in the middle.\n\nAnd honestly? Setting it up was **ridiculously easy**. I ran the Deco project locally, opened their MCP store, clicked to authenticate the MCPs I wanted (Gmail, Notion, Calendar), selected the tools I needed, and exported everything as a single link — that's the mesh. That one URL is what I used in TrampoAI. No manual configuration for each server. No credential juggling. Just click, authenticate, export. Done.\n\n\u003CInteractiveDiagram \n  title=\"MCP Mesh Architecture\"\n  nodes={[\n    { id: \"clients\", label: \"Clients\", icon: \"💻\" },\n    { id: \"mesh\", label: \"MCP Mesh\", icon: \"🔀\" },\n    { id: \"servers\", label: \"MCP Servers\", icon: \"⚙️\" }\n  ]}\n/>\n\nMCP Mesh provides:\n\n### 1. One Endpoint for Everything\n\nNo matter how many MCP Servers you have. Your clients connect to **a single endpoint**. The Mesh routes to the right tools.\n\n### 2. RBAC and Policies\n\nAccess control at the control plane level. Who can use which tool? Does it need approval to execute? All configurable.\n\n### 3. Observability\n\nUnified logs for all executions. Latency, errors, costs — all in one place.\n\n### 4. Smart Routing\n\nWhen you have many tools, sending all of them to the LLM gets expensive (tokens) and slow. The Mesh has intelligent selection strategies.\n\n### 5. No Vendor Lock-in\n\nOpen-source, self-hosted. Runs on your Kubernetes, on your infrastructure. You're in control.\n\n```bash\n# Run locally in 1 minute\nnpx @decocms/mesh\n```\n\nI work at Deco, so I'm obviously biased. But I genuinely believe this is the direction things are going. As MCP adoption grows, the need for proper infrastructure to manage it becomes critical — just like how APIs needed \u003CTooltip client:load content=\"An API Gateway is a server that acts as a single entry point for multiple backend services, handling authentication, rate limiting, and routing.\">API gateways\u003C/Tooltip>, MCP needs its own management layer.\n\n## A Glimpse of the Future\n\nLet me share something I've been thinking about a lot.\n\nI imagine a future where everyone has their own personal MCP mesh — a web of connections to all your contexts, your information, your tools, your life. And alongside it, your own AI agent. Not a product you use. A companion that *knows you*.\n\nThink about it: you're walking around, talking to your AI about an idea you just had. You tell it to save a note. You ask about that message your friend sent yesterday. You wonder out loud what your week looks like, and it just *tells you* — because it knows. It has access to everything you've given it permission to see.\n\nYour emails, your calendar, your notes, your messages, your documents, your photos, your music, your finances — all connected, all contextual, all *yours*.\n\nThis isn't science fiction. The pieces are already here. MCP is the protocol. The mesh is the infrastructure. The agents are getting smarter every day. What's missing is just time — and adoption.\n\nI truly believe we're heading toward a world where your AI isn't just a tool you open when you need something. It's always there, always aware of your context, always ready to help. Like having a brilliant friend who never forgets anything and is genuinely trying to make your life easier.\n\nThat's the future I'm excited about. And honestly? We're closer than most people think.\n\n## What I Learned\n\nBuilding TrampoAI was real proof of how things work under the hood.\n\n\u003CFlowTimeline\n  title=\"Key Takeaways\"\n  steps={[\n    { \n      title: \"MCP is simple\", \n      description: \"The protocol itself is elegant. SSE + JSON-RPC. Easy to implement.\",\n      icon: \"✅\"\n    },\n    { \n      title: \"Context changes everything\", \n      description: \"A smaller model with your context beats a bigger model without it.\",\n      icon: \"🎯\"\n    },\n    { \n      title: \"Managing is complex\", \n      description: \"Multiple servers, credentials, connections... quickly becomes chaos.\",\n      icon: \"⚠️\"\n    },\n    { \n      title: \"You need a Mesh\", \n      description: \"For production, you need a control plane. Simple as that.\",\n      icon: \"🔀\"\n    }\n  ]}\n/>\n\n## Conclusion\n\nHere's my take: the next leap in AI usefulness won't come from bigger models or better training. It will come from better context.\n\nA model with perfect knowledge and zero context about your life is less useful than a smaller model that knows exactly what you're working on, what you need to do, and what tools you have available.\n\nWe're moving from \"AI as oracle\" to \"AI as assistant.\" An oracle answers questions. An assistant knows your world and acts within it.\n\n**Your AI is only as useful as the context you give it.**\n\n---\n\nIf you want to understand how this works in practice, check out [TrampoAI](https://github.com/viniciusventura29/TrampoAI). It's open-source and you can run it locally in 5 minutes.\n\nAnd if you want to explore contextual AI yourself, start small. Pick one tool you use daily — maybe your calendar or your notes app — and find an MCP server for it. Connect it to your AI client and see what becomes possible.\n\nThe shift from generic to contextual AI isn't coming. It's already here.\n\nLet me know what you think on my socials.

If you want to understand real-time communication, click here!","Dec 11 2022","/blogg/websocket/websocketWallpaper.jpg","Some months ago I worked on some projects using this protocol, and in this article I'll share what I learned.\n\n## What is WebSocket and why is it used?\n\nWebSocket is a different way of handling communication on the web. Unlike HTTP, WebSocket doesn't follow the traditional \"request-response\" model. Instead, it provides bilateral communication, which gives us the ability to receive information from the server without explicitly requesting it.\n\n## How HTTP works\n\nLet's quickly understand how HTTP works to better appreciate WebSocket.\n\nIn HTTP, we need to make a request to receive a response. See the example below:\n\n![HTTP request-response model](/blogg/websocket/http.png)\n\nI asked for a website page, and it returned what I requested. Following the same logic, if I don't ask for anything, I won't receive anything!\n\nThis is where problems arise. Imagine building a real-time application with HTTP... We can't know when new information arrives on the server, and the client will only get updates if they explicitly ask for them. To achieve something close to real-time, we would need to make endless requests, even when there's nothing new to receive. That's a lot of constant requests just to check if something has changed.\n\n## Polling\n\nTo work around this problem, there's a technique called polling. It's when a system regularly checks another system for updates by sending periodic requests.\n\nThis technique was developed to achieve a near-real-time experience without consuming excessive computing resources.\n\n### Example\n\n![Polling example](/blogg/websocket/polling.png)\n\nIn this example, the client sends a request to the server every 30 seconds. When the server receives that request, it returns a response with any available updates.\n\n## How WebSocket works\n\nWebSocket brings us a solution for this type of problem. As I mentioned earlier, WebSocket doesn't follow the HTTP model of \"request and response\". Instead, it's like a tunnel of information — constantly sending and receiving.\n\nThe client doesn't have to \"ask\" for information to receive updates. The server sends them automatically. Both sides can communicate freely: client to server and server to client.\n\n![WebSocket bilateral communication](/blogg/websocket/websocket.png)\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWebSocket is an interesting protocol, but it's not appropriate for all cases. Developing with this protocol isn't the easiest thing to do, and you might lose performance in certain scenarios. So, you need to think carefully and evaluate whether it's worth using this technology in your application.\n\nThis is the end of this short article. I hope you learned something and enjoyed it!

Instead, it provides bilateral communication, which gives us the ability to receive information from the server without explicitly requesting it.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"how-http-works\">How HTTP works\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Let’s quickly understand how HTTP works to better appreciate WebSocket.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In HTTP, we need to make a request to receive a response. See the example below:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"/blogg/websocket/http.png\" alt=\"HTTP request-response model\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I asked for a website page, and it returned what I requested. Following the same logic, if I don’t ask for anything, I won’t receive anything!\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>This is where problems arise. Imagine building a real-time application with HTTP… We can’t know when new information arrives on the server, and the client will only get updates if they explicitly ask for them. To achieve something close to real-time, we would need to make endless requests, even when there’s nothing new to receive. That’s a lot of constant requests just to check if something has changed.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"polling\">Polling\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>To work around this problem, there’s a technique called polling. It’s when a system regularly checks another system for updates by sending periodic requests.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>This technique was developed to achieve a near-real-time experience without consuming excessive computing resources.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"example\">Example\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"/blogg/websocket/polling.png\" alt=\"Polling example\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In this example, the client sends a request to the server every 30 seconds.

As I mentioned earlier, WebSocket doesn’t follow the HTTP model of “request and response”. Instead, it’s like a tunnel of information — constantly sending and receiving.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The client doesn’t have to “ask” for information to receive updates. The server sends them automatically. Both sides can communicate freely: client to server and server to client.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"/blogg/websocket/websocket.png\" alt=\"WebSocket bilateral communication\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>WebSocket is an interesting protocol, but it’s not appropriate for all cases.

That's normal.\n\nThe real problem is when people take sides and only see one perspective.\n\nThis happens a lot!\n\nI was on Twitter and saw a big discussion thread about **Which is better: monolith or microservices?**\n\nSo, this article is to share my opinion on the topic.\n\n## The Beginning\n\nBefore this type of discussion existed, there was already a way to build applications, and that way is called *Monolith*.\n\nMonolith was conceived first because, most of the time, it's a simpler architecture (though that's not always the case). Let's understand what exactly a *monolith* project is:\n\n### Understanding a monolith\n\n\u003CInteractiveDiagram \n  title=\"E-commerce Monolith Architecture\"\n  nodes={[\n    { id: \"frontend\", label: \"Frontend\", icon: \"🖥️\" },\n    { id: \"backend\", label: \"Backend (API)\", icon: \"⚙️\" },\n    { id: \"database\", label: \"Database\", icon: \"🗄️\" }\n  ]}\n/>\n\nThis is an example of an e-commerce application. To better explain what's happening, we have this e-commerce split into three parts:\n- **Frontend**: what the end user sees and interacts with\n- **Backend**: where all the application logic lives\n- **Database**: where all the data and information of our e-commerce is stored\n\nSo, this is a single system with all modules and functionality within it. One project, one codebase, one database, one programming language!\n\n### Good Points\n\nThat singularity brings us many advantages:\n\n\u003CBeforeAfterCompare\n  before={{\n    title: \"Without Monolith\",\n    description: \"Scattered development without unified structure\",\n    items: [\n      \"Multiple codebases to manage\",\n      \"Different patterns in each service\",\n      \"Complex deployment orchestration\",\n      \"Technology fragmentation\"\n    ]\n  }}\n  after={{\n    title: \"With Monolith\",\n    description: \"Unified development with consistent structure\",\n    items: [\n      \"Single repository, single codebase\",\n      \"Consistent patterns and logic\",\n      \"One deployment pipeline\",\n      \"Rapid development cycle\"\n    ]\n  }}\n/>\n\nMonolith has a lot of good points.\n\n---\n\nImagine that our e-commerce has all these functionalities:\n\n\u003CInteractiveDiagram \n  title=\"E-commerce Features (All in One)\"\n  nodes={[\n    { id: \"auth\", label: \"Auth\", icon: \"🔐\" },\n    { id: \"products\", label: \"Products\", icon: \"📦\" },\n    { id: \"cart\", label: \"Cart\", icon: \"🛒\" },\n    { id: \"payments\", label: \"Payments\", icon: \"💳\" },\n    { id: \"notifications\", label: \"Notifications\", icon: \"🔔\" },\n    { id: \"shipping\", label: \"Shipping\", icon: \"🚚\" }\n  ]}\n/>\n\nIt's a great application, right? We have many functionalities coupled together, and this brings us to the first problem of monoliths...\n\n### Bad Points\n\nAs I said, all functionalities are highly coupled, which means that if one functionality breaks, all the others break too.\n\n\u003CFlowTimeline\n  title=\"When Notifications Break...\"\n  steps={[\n    { \n      title: \"Notification Service Crashes\", \n      description: \"An unhandled exception occurs in the notifications module.\",\n      icon: \"💥\"\n    },\n    { \n      title: \"Backend Goes Down\", \n      description: \"Since everything is in the same process, the entire backend crashes.\",\n      icon: \"⚠️\"\n    },\n    { \n      title: \"All Services Unavailable\", \n      description: \"Auth, Products, Cart, Payments, Shipping — everything stops working.\",\n      icon: \"🚫\"\n    },\n    { \n      title: \"Users Can't Access Anything\", \n      description: \"Complete service outage. Users see error pages everywhere.\",\n      icon: \"😱\"\n    }\n  ]}\n/>\n\nIn our example, the notification functionality had a problem, and because of it, the entire application is down.\n\nUnfortunately, this isn't the only problem with monolith applications...\n\n\u003CBeforeAfterCompare\n  before={{\n    title: \"Monolith Challenges\",\n    description: \"Issues that arise as the application grows\",\n    items: [\n      \"Scaling requires duplicating the entire app\",\n      \"Codebase grows exponentially\",\n      \"Single point of failure\",\n      \"Deployment = everything or nothing\"\n    ]\n  }}\n  after={{\n    title: \"What You Need\",\n    description: \"Ideal characteristics for large-scale systems\",\n    items: [\n      \"Scale only what needs scaling\",\n      \"Smaller, manageable codebases\",\n      \"Isolated failures\",\n      \"Independent deployments\"\n    ]\n  }}\n/>\n\n## The Present\n\nLooking at these problems, software architects wanted to find a better way to build software, so they came up with a solution.\n\nThe term \"microservices\" was coined in May 2011 during a software architects conference to represent a style of system architecture. The microservices-oriented architecture proposal is to develop systems that are more flexible, scalable, and simpler to maintain than monolithic architectures.\n\nBut the first question is: how exactly does it work?\n\n### Understanding microservices\n\nIn a microservices architecture, modules and functions are split apart. It's as if each service is a standalone application. See the example below:\n\n\u003Cdiv class=\"my-10 p-6 rounded-xl bg-zinc-900/60 border border-zinc-800\">\n  \u003Cp class=\"text-center text-xs text-zinc-500 mb-6 uppercase tracking-widest

**completely independent**:\n- **Different technologies**: Each team chooses what works best (Node, Go, Python, Java, Rust, C#)\n- **Own database**: No shared state between services\n- **Isolated deployment**: Deploy one without touching others\n\n#### Observations\n\nMicroservices are occasionally misconstrued as Pattern-Oriented Software Architecture (POSA); however, it's essential to recognize that they are distinct concepts.\n\nThe company *RedHat* says this about it:\n\n> The main characteristic that differentiates them is scope: SOA is an architectural approach adopted by the enterprise as a whole, while microservices are an implementation strategy of the development team for each application.\n\nWith that in mind, let's continue.\n\n### Good Points\n\nA major advantage of microservices architecture is that if one microservice stops, the entire application doesn't break!\n\n\u003CFlowTimeline\n  title=\"When Notifications Break in Microservices...\"\n  steps={[\n    { \n      title: \"Notification Service Crashes\", \n      description: \"The notifications microservice encounters an error.\",\n      icon: \"💥\"\n    },\n    { \n      title: \"Other Services Keep Running\", \n      description: \"Auth, Products, Cart, Payments — all continue working normally.\",\n      icon: \"✅\"\n    },\n    { \n      title: \"Graceful Degradation\", \n      description: \"Users can still shop, pay, and use the app. Only notifications are delayed.\",\n      icon: \"🛡️\"\n    },\n    { \n      title: \"Easy Recovery\", \n      description: \"Ops team restarts just the notification service. No full redeploy needed.\",\n      icon: \"🔄\"\n    }\n  ]}\n/>\n\nHere we can see that if one of the microservices breaks, the others keep working. This is great because it brings us more consistency and reliability.\n\nMicroservices bring many benefits:\n\n\u003CBeforeAfterCompare\n  before={{\n    title: \"Monolith Limitations\",\n    description: \"What you're limited to with monolithic architecture\",\n    items: [\n      \"One massive codebase for everything\",\n      \"Complex code that's hard to understand\",\n      \"Deploy everything at once\",\n      \"Stuck with one programming language\"\n    ]\n  }}\n  after={{\n    title: \"Microservices Benefits\",\n    description: \"What microservices architecture enables\",\n    items: [\n      \"Smaller, focused codebases\",\n      \"Each service is easy to understand\",\n      \"Deploy services independently\",\n      \"Use the best language for each service\"\n    ]\n  }}\n/>\n\nAs you can see, microservices have many advantages and are used to some extent by almost every large tech company nowadays, since they provide many capabilities for organizations to scale their systems properly.\n\n### Bad Points\n\nUnfortunately, microservices aren't perfect. This software architecture has problems, so let's talk about some of them.\n\n\u003CFlowTimeline\n  title=\"Microservices Complexity\"\n  steps={[\n    { \n      title: \"Distributed System Challenges\", \n      description: \"Network calls can fail. Latency becomes a concern. Debugging across services is hard.\",\n      icon: \"🌐\"\n    },\n    { \n      title: \"Deployment Overhead\", \n      description: \"Each service needs its own CI/CD pipeline, monitoring, and infrastructure.\",\n      icon: \"🔧\"\n    },\n    { \n      title: \"Data Consistency\", \n      description: \"Keeping data in sync across services requires careful design (sagas, event sourcing).\",\n      icon: \"🔄\"\n    },\n    { \n      title: \"Increased Costs\", \n      description: \"More services = more servers, more monitoring, more operational complexity.\",\n      icon: \"💰\"\n    }\n  ]}\n/>\n\nMicroservices are usually complex. They need to be very well planned and executed because, if not, the software can become insecure, vulnerable, and hard to understand as a whole.\n\nThe truth is, microservices are excellent but can also be a shot in the foot.\n\n## The Future?\n\nSo, to finally answer the awaited question... **Which is better?**\n\nIn my opinion, it depends on the situation :)\n\n\u003CBeforeAfterCompare\n  before={{\n    title: \"Use Monolith When\",\n    description: \"Scenarios where monolith makes more sense\",\n    items: [\n      \"Small team (\u003C 10 developers)\",\n      \"Simple business logic\",\n      \"MVP or early-stage startup\",\n      \"Limited budget for infrastructure\"\n    ]\n  }}\n  after={{\n    title: \"Use Microservices When\",\n    description: \"Scenarios where microservices shine\",\n    items: [\n      \"Large team with multiple squads\",\n      \"Complex, evolving business rules\",\n      \"High scale requirements\",\n      \"Need for independent deployments\"\n    ]\n  }}\n/>\n\nWe, as developers, need to be smart when choosing one architecture over another. For example, it's not smart to use microservices architecture for a website for a small local store because the development will be slower, the website probably won't have complex business rules, and it will be more expensive.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIt's important to always be open-minded. Microservices have become mainstream in software development, but that doesn't mean we should only use them. There are other types of software architecture like Component-Based Architecture, Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA), Layered Architecture, and others.\n\nI think a good developer must understand when to use one or the other.\n\n---\n\nContact me and tell me what you think about this article!\n\nHope you liked it.","src/content/blog/monovsmicro.mdx","2d924619c66dcb84","monovsmicro.mdx","purpose",{"id":99,"data":101,"body":20,"filePath":105,"digest":106,"legacyId":107,"deferredRender":24},{"title":102,"description":15,"publishDate":103,"image":104,"time":18,"draft":24},"Purpose","jan 02 2026","/blogg/purpose/purpose.jpg","src/content/blog/purpose.mdx","308f622f6f85f975","purpose.mdx"]
