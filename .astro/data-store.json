Asking questions and hoping for useful answers?\n\nI was too. And I was missing the point.\n\n## The Problem: AI Without Context\n\nLet me be honest: \u003CTooltip client:load content=\"Large Language Models - AI systems trained on massive amounts of text data to understand and generate human-like text\">ChatGPT, Claude, and other LLMs\u003C/Tooltip> are incredible. They can write code, explain complex topics, and help you think through problems. But there's a fundamental limitation that most people don't think about.\n\n**They know nothing about you.**\n\nThey don't know about your work. They don't know what meetings you have scheduled. They don't know what tasks are piling up on your to-do list. They don't know the codebase you're working on or the documents your team shares. They don't know about you.\n\n\n## The Shift: Context is King\n\nHere's what I've learned: the new way to use AI isn't about crafting better \u003CTooltip client:load content=\"Prompts are the instructions or questions you give to an AI. Prompt engineering is the practice of designing these instructions to get better outputs.\">prompts\u003C/Tooltip> or learning magic techniques. It's about giving AI access to your world.\n\nWhen AI has context about your environment — your emails, your calendar, your documents, your tools — something magical happens. It stops just *answering* and starts *acting*.\n\nInstead of asking \"How should I organize my emails?\" you can say \"Analyze my emails from today, summarize the important ones, and create tasks for anything that requires action.\"\n\nAnd it just... does it.\n\n\u003CBeforeAfterCompare \n  before={{\n    title: \"AI Without Context\",\n    description: \"Generic answers that apply to anyone\",\n    items: [\n      \"Copy-paste information manually\",\n      \"Adapt generic answers to your situation\",\n      \"Do the actual work yourself\",\n      \"AI as 'fancy autocomplete'\"\n    ]\n  }}\n  after={{\n    title: \"AI With Context\",\n    description: \"Personalized actions based on your world\",\n    items: [\n      \"AI understands your environment\",\n      \"Receives specific, actionable responses\",\n      \"Automates real tasks end-to-end\",\n      \"AI as true assistant\"\n    ]\n  }}\n/>\n\n## MCP: The Protocol Making This Possible\n\nIf you haven't heard about \u003CTooltip client:load content=\"Model Context Protocol - An open standard created by Anthropic that allows AI models to connect to external tools and data sources through a universal interface.\">MCP (Model Context Protocol)\u003C/Tooltip>, it's worth understanding. In simple terms, MCP is a standard way to connect AI models to external tools and data sources.\n\nIn practice:\n- **Connect Gmail** → AI can read, search, summarize, and send your emails\n- **Connect Calendar** → AI can check availability, schedule meetings, and block time\n- **Connect Notion** → AI can create pages, update databases, and organize your notes\n- **Connect GitHub** → AI can review PRs, create issues, and check build status\n\n\nThink of it as a universal adapter. Instead of building custom integrations for every AI tool, MCP provides a common language. Any MCP-compatible client (like \u003CTooltip client:load content=\"Cursor is an AI-powered code editor that integrates AI directly into the development workflow. Claude Desktop is Anthropic's official desktop application for interacting with Claude.\">Cursor, Claude Desktop\u003C/Tooltip>, or custom agents) can connect to any MCP server and use its capabilities.\n\n> If you want to dive deeper into MCP, check out the [official documentation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) and the [Anthropic announcement](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol).\n\nThe beauty of MCP is that it's open. Anyone can create an MCP server for their tool, and suddenly that tool becomes available to any AI that speaks MCP.\n\n## My Setup: From Theory to Practice\n\nLet me share a real example from my own workflow.\n\nI connected three services through MCP:\n\n\u003CNetworkMesh \n  title=\"My Connected Services\"\n  user={{ label: \"You\", icon: \"👤\" }}\n  agent={{ label: \"AI Agent\", icon: \"🤖\" }}\n  gateway={{ label: \"MCP Gateway\", icon: \"🔗\" }}\n  mcps={[\n    { id: \"gmail\", label: \"Gmail\", icon: \"📧\" },\n    { id: \"notion\", label: \"Notion\", icon: \"📝\" },\n    { id: \"calendar\", label: \"Calendar\", icon: \"📅\" }\n  ]}\n/>\n\nThen I asked the AI something like this:\n\n> \"Look at the emails I received today. Summarize what's important. Find any emails that require action or a decision from me, create tasks for them in Notion, and then block some time on my calendar for me to handle these tasks.\"\n\n\u003CFlowTimeline \n  title=\"What Actually Happens\"\n  steps={[\n    { \n      title: \"Email Analysis\", \n      description: \"AI scans today's inbox and identifies important messages\",\n      icon: \"📬\"\n    },\n    { \n      title: \"Smart Summarization\", \n      description: \"Creates concise summaries with action items highlighted\",\n      icon: \"📋\"\n    },\n    { \n      title: \"Task Creation\", \n      description: \"Automatically creates tasks in Notion for each action item\",\n      icon: \"✅\"\n    },\n    { \n      title: \"Calendar Blocking\", \n      description: \"Finds available time slots and blocks them for task completion\",\n      icon: \"⏰\"\n    }\n  ]}\n/>\n\nAnd it worked. Not as a demonstration or a proof of concept — as an actual workflow I now use.\n\nBut it doesn't stop at actions. I can also *ask* about anything in that context. \"What was that email from last week about the project deadline?\" or \"Do I have any conflicts next Tuesday?\" — the AI searches through my connected services and gives me answers based on my actual data, not generic responses.\n\nThis is the difference between AI that *informs* and AI that *acts*. I didn't ask for information. I asked for action. And because the AI had context about my email, my calendar, and my task management system, it could actually deliver.\n\nAnd here's the thing: you don't lose the ability to just *ask questions*. You still can — but now you get sharper, more accurate answers because the AI actually knows your context. You're not replacing anything. You're gaining actions *on top of* better-informed responses.\n\n## Going Further: The Possibilities\n\nOnce you understand this paradigm, the possibilities explode.\n\n### Communication Integration\n\nConnect \u003CTooltip client:load content=\"Popular team communication platforms used in workplaces for real-time messaging and collaboration.\">Slack and Teams\u003C/Tooltip> to your AI. Now it can analyze messages across all your communication channels, not just email. Imagine asking: \"Summarize everything that happened in my work channels while I was in meetings.\"\n\n### Development Workflow\n\nConnect GitHub or \u003CTooltip client:load content=\"Jira is a project management tool by Atlassian commonly used for bug tracking, issue tracking, and agile project management.\">Jira\u003C/Tooltip>. When someone assigns an issue to you, the AI can automatically create a task and notify you. Or ask it to review the PRs waiting for your review and draft responses based on the code changes.\n\n### Personal Productivity\n\nConnect your banking app for weekly spending summaries. Connect Spotify to create focus playlists based on your calendar blocks. The possibilities are endless.\n\nThe pattern is always the same: give AI context, and it becomes exponentially more useful.\n\n## Managing the Complexity: MCP Mesh\n\nAs you connect more and more services, things can get messy. How do you manage authentication for ten different MCP servers? How do you control which AI agents can access which tools? How do you track what's being called and why?\n\nThis is where solutions like [deco's MCP Mesh](https://www.decocms.com/mesh) come in. Instead of wiring every client to every MCP server, a mesh provides a single control plane. One endpoint, centralized authentication, access policies, and observability across all your MCP traffic.\n\nI work at deco, so I'm obviously biased. But I genuinely believe this is the direction things are going. As MCP adoption grows, the need for proper infrastructure to manage it becomes critical — just like how APIs needed \u003CTooltip client:load content=\"An API Gateway is a server that acts as a single entry point for multiple backend services, handling authentication, rate limiting, and routing.\">API gateways\u003C/Tooltip>, MCP needs its own management layer.\n\n## A Glimpse of the Future\n\nLet me share something I've been thinking about a lot.\n\nI imagine a future where everyone has their own personal MCP mesh — a web of connections to all your contexts, your information, your tools, your life. And alongside it, your own AI agent. Not a product you use. A companion that *knows you*.\n\nThink about it: you're walking around, talking to your AI about an idea you just had. You tell it to save a note. You ask about that message your friend sent yesterday. You wonder out loud what your week looks like, and it just *tells you* — because it knows. It has access to everything you've given it permission to see.\n\nYour emails, your calendar, your notes, your messages, your documents, your photos, your music, your finances — all connected, all contextual, all *yours*.\n\nThis isn't science fiction. The pieces are already here. MCP is the protocol. The mesh is the infrastructure. The agents are getting smarter every day. What's missing is just time — and adoption.\n\nI truly believe we're heading toward a world where your AI isn't just a tool you open when you need something. It's always there, always aware of your context, always ready to help. Like having a brilliant friend who never forgets anything and is genuinely trying to make your life easier.\n\nThat's the future I'm excited about. And honestly? We're closer than most people think.\n\n## Conclusion: The Future is Contextual\n\nHere's my take: the next leap in AI usefulness won't come from bigger models or better training. It will come from better context.\n\nA model with perfect knowledge and zero context about your life is less useful than a smaller model that knows exactly what you're working on, what you need to do, and what tools you have available.\n\nWe're moving from \"AI as oracle\" to \"AI as assistant.\" An oracle answers questions. An assistant knows your world and acts within it.\n\n**Your AI is only as useful as the context you give it.**\n\n---\n\nIf you want to explore this yourself, start small. Pick one tool you use daily — maybe your calendar or your notes app — and find an MCP server for it. Connect it to your AI client and see what becomes possible.\n\nThe shift from generic to contextual AI isn't coming. It's already here.\n\nLet me know what you think about this on my socials.

That's normal.\n\nThe real problem is when people take sides and only see one perspective.\n\nThis happens a lot!\n\nI was on Twitter and saw a big discussion thread about **Which is better: monolith or microservices?**\n\nSo, this article is to share my opinion on the topic.\n\n## The Beginning\n\nBefore this type of discussion existed, there was already a way to build applications, and that way is called *Monolith*.\n\nMonolith was conceived first because, most of the time, it's a simpler architecture (though that's not always the case). Let's understand what exactly a *monolith* project is:\n\n### Understanding a monolith\n\n![Monolith e-commerce example](/blogg/monoVSmicro/e-commerce_monolito1.png)\n\nThis is an example of an e-commerce application. To better explain what's happening, we have this e-commerce split into three parts:\n- **Frontend**: what the end user sees and interacts with\n- **Backend**: where all the application logic lives\n- **Database**: where all the data and information of our e-commerce is stored\n\nSo, this is a single system with all modules and functionality within it. One project, one codebase, one database, one programming language!\n\n### Good Points\n\nThat singularity brings us many advantages:\n\n- **Architectural simplicity**\n  > All code is in the same repository following the same logic and patterns.\n\n- **Technology consistency**\n  > The entire software uses a single programming language.\n\n- **Simple publishing flow**\n  > It's one repository, so there's only one program to publish.\n\n- **Rapid development**\n  > With one programming language, one business rule, and one coding pattern to follow, development is usually faster.\n\nMonolith has a lot of good points.\n\n---\n\nImagine that our e-commerce has all these functionalities:\n\n![E-commerce with many features](/blogg/monoVSmicro/e-commerce_monolito2.png)\n\nIt's a great application, right? We have many functionalities coupled together, and this brings us to the first problem of monoliths...\n\n### Bad Points\n\nAs I said, all functionalities are highly coupled, which means that if one functionality breaks, all the others break too.\n\n![Monolith breaking](/blogg/monoVSmicro/e-commerce_monolito3.png)\n![All services down](/blogg/monoVSmicro/e-commerce_monolito4.png)\n\nIn our example, the notification functionality had a problem, and because of it, the entire application is down.\n\nUnfortunately, this isn't the only problem with monolith applications...\n\nSince a monolith is a single app that contains all the functionalities and modules of your application, it becomes tricky when you need to scale. Another point to be aware of is the codebase size — as the software needs more capacity or functionality, the codebase grows with the application.\n\n## The Present\n\nLooking at these problems, software architects wanted to find a better way to build software, so they came up with a solution.\n\nThe term \"microservices\" was coined in May 2011 during a software architects conference to represent a style of system architecture. The microservices-oriented architecture proposal is to develop systems that are more flexible, scalable, and simpler to maintain than monolithic architectures.\n\nBut the first question is: how exactly does it work?\n\n### Understanding microservices\n\nIn a microservices architecture, modules and functions are split apart. It's as if each service is a standalone application. See the example below:\n\n![Microservices architecture](/blogg/monoVSmicro/e-commerce_microservice1.png)\n\nHere we can see all the main functions separated, but they're all micro parts of something bigger — the final application itself.\n\nFollowing this logic, each microservice has its own database, its own logic, and its own codebase.\n\n#### Observations\n\nMicroservices are occasionally misconstrued as Pattern-Oriented Software Architecture (POSA); however, it's essential to recognize that they are distinct concepts.\n\nThe company *RedHat* says this about it:\n\n> The main characteristic that differentiates them is scope: SOA is an architectural approach adopted by the enterprise as a whole, while microservices are an implementation strategy of the development team for each application.\n\nWith that in mind, let's continue.\n\n### Good Points\n\nA major advantage of microservices architecture is that if one microservice stops, the entire application doesn't break!\n\nFor example:\n\n![One microservice down, others running](/blogg/monoVSmicro/e-commerce_microservice2.png)\n\nHere we can see that if one of the microservices breaks, the others keep working. This is great because it brings us more consistency and reliability.\n\nMicroservices bring many benefits:\n\n- **Smaller codebase**\n  > Each microservice is responsible for its own code, so there's less code in different repositories.\n\n- **More understandable code**\n  > It's easier to understand because the code is smaller and limited to the functionality of that module.\n\n- **Independent deployment**\n  > Each module is developed to work by itself, meaning you can deploy or integrate it independently.\n\n- **Technology flexibility**\n  > In a single microservice, you can use whatever programming language you want or have more affinity with.\n\n- **Well-defined boundaries between modules**\n  > Microservices force you to split your application business logic into modules and provide a mental framework to do so.\n\nAs you can see, microservices have many advantages and are used to some extent by almost every large tech company nowadays, since they provide many capabilities for organizations to scale their systems properly.\n\n### Bad Points\n\nUnfortunately, microservices aren't perfect. This software architecture has problems, so let's talk about some of them.\n\nMicroservices are usually complex. They need to be very well planned and executed because, if not, the software can become insecure, vulnerable, and hard to understand as a whole.\n\nAnother point to keep in mind is the difficulty of deploying a microservices application — you have to deploy each service independently. This costs more money and time.\n\nThe truth is, microservices are excellent but can also be a shot in the foot.\n\n## The Future?\n\nSo, to finally answer the awaited question... **Which is better?**\n\nIn my opinion, it depends on the situation :)\n\nWe, as developers, need to be smart when choosing one architecture over another. For example, it's not smart to use microservices architecture for a website for a small local store because the development will be slower, the website probably won't have complex business rules, and it will be more expensive.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIt's important to always be open-minded. Microservices have become mainstream in software development, but that doesn't mean we should only use them. There are other types of software architecture like Component-Based Architecture, Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA), Layered Architecture, and others.\n\nI think a good developer must understand when to use one or the other.\n\n---\n\nContact me and tell me what you think about this article!\n\nHope you liked it.","src/content/blog/monovsmicro.md","707ed8bec2ae8b18",{"html":61,"metadata":62},"\u003Cp>When we talk about software development, many doubts and discussions come up — like which programming language is better, which database to use, or even how to deploy the application.

This software architecture has problems, so let’s talk about some of them.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Microservices are usually complex. They need to be very well planned and executed because, if not, the software can become insecure, vulnerable, and hard to understand as a whole.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Another point to keep in mind is the difficulty of deploying a microservices application — you have to deploy each service independently.

Unlike HTTP, WebSocket doesn't follow the traditional \"request-response\" model. Instead, it provides bilateral communication, which gives us the ability to receive information from the server without explicitly requesting it.\n\n## How HTTP works\n\nLet's quickly understand how HTTP works to better appreciate WebSocket.\n\nIn HTTP, we need to make a request to receive a response. See the example below:\n\n![HTTP request-response model](/blogg/websocket/http.png)\n\nI asked for a website page, and it returned what I requested. Following the same logic, if I don't ask for anything, I won't receive anything!\n\nThis is where problems arise. Imagine building a real-time application with HTTP... We can't know when new information arrives on the server, and the client will only get updates if they explicitly ask for them. To achieve something close to real-time, we would need to make endless requests, even when there's nothing new to receive. That's a lot of constant requests just to check if something has changed.\n\n## Polling\n\nTo work around this problem, there's a technique called polling. It's when a system regularly checks another system for updates by sending periodic requests.\n\nThis technique was developed to achieve a near-real-time experience without consuming excessive computing resources.\n\n### Example\n\n![Polling example](/blogg/websocket/polling.png)\n\nIn this example, the client sends a request to the server every 30 seconds. When the server receives that request, it returns a response with any available updates.\n\n## How WebSocket works\n\nWebSocket brings us a solution for this type of problem. As I mentioned earlier, WebSocket doesn't follow the HTTP model of \"request and response\". Instead, it's like a tunnel of information — constantly sending and receiving.\n\nThe client doesn't have to \"ask\" for information to receive updates. The server sends them automatically. Both sides can communicate freely: client to server and server to client.\n\n![WebSocket bilateral communication](/blogg/websocket/websocket.png)\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWebSocket is an interesting protocol, but it's not appropriate for all cases. Developing with this protocol isn't the easiest thing to do, and you might lose performance in certain scenarios. So, you need to think carefully and evaluate whether it's worth using this technology in your application.\n\nThis is the end of this short article. I hope you learned something and enjoyed it!
