That's normal.\n\nThe real problem is when people take sides and only see one perspective.\n\nThis happens a lot!\n\nI was on Twitter and saw a big discussion thread about **Which is better: monolith or microservices?**\n\nSo, this article is to share my opinion on the topic.\n\n## The Beginning\n\nBefore this type of discussion existed, there was already a way to build applications, and that way is called *Monolith*.\n\nMonolith was conceived first because, most of the time, it's a simpler architecture (though that's not always the case). Let's understand what exactly a *monolith* project is:\n\n### Understanding a monolith\n\n\u003CInteractiveDiagram \n  title=\"E-commerce Monolith Architecture\"\n  nodes={[\n    { id: \"frontend\", label: \"Frontend\", icon: \"🖥️\" },\n    { id: \"backend\", label: \"Backend (API)\", icon: \"⚙️\" },\n    { id: \"database\", label: \"Database\", icon: \"🗄️\" }\n  ]}\n/>\n\nThis is an example of an e-commerce application. To better explain what's happening, we have this e-commerce split into three parts:\n- **Frontend**: what the end user sees and interacts with\n- **Backend**: where all the application logic lives\n- **Database**: where all the data and information of our e-commerce is stored\n\nSo, this is a single system with all modules and functionality within it. One project, one codebase, one database, one programming language!\n\n### Good Points\n\nThat singularity brings us many advantages:\n\n\u003CBeforeAfterCompare\n  before={{\n    title: \"Without Monolith\",\n    description: \"Scattered development without unified structure\",\n    items: [\n      \"Multiple codebases to manage\",\n      \"Different patterns in each service\",\n      \"Complex deployment orchestration\",\n      \"Technology fragmentation\"\n    ]\n  }}\n  after={{\n    title: \"With Monolith\",\n    description: \"Unified development with consistent structure\",\n    items: [\n      \"Single repository, single codebase\",\n      \"Consistent patterns and logic\",\n      \"One deployment pipeline\",\n      \"Rapid development cycle\"\n    ]\n  }}\n/>\n\nMonolith has a lot of good points.\n\n---\n\nImagine that our e-commerce has all these functionalities:\n\n\u003CInteractiveDiagram \n  title=\"E-commerce Features (All in One)\"\n  nodes={[\n    { id: \"auth\", label: \"Auth\", icon: \"🔐\" },\n    { id: \"products\", label: \"Products\", icon: \"📦\" },\n    { id: \"cart\", label: \"Cart\", icon: \"🛒\" },\n    { id: \"payments\", label: \"Payments\", icon: \"💳\" },\n    { id: \"notifications\", label: \"Notifications\", icon: \"🔔\" },\n    { id: \"shipping\", label: \"Shipping\", icon: \"🚚\" }\n  ]}\n/>\n\nIt's a great application, right? We have many functionalities coupled together, and this brings us to the first problem of monoliths...\n\n### Bad Points\n\nAs I said, all functionalities are highly coupled, which means that if one functionality breaks, all the others break too.\n\n\u003CFlowTimeline\n  title=\"When Notifications Break...\"\n  steps={[\n    { \n      title: \"Notification Service Crashes\", \n      description: \"An unhandled exception occurs in the notifications module.\",\n      icon: \"💥\"\n    },\n    { \n      title: \"Backend Goes Down\", \n      description: \"Since everything is in the same process, the entire backend crashes.\",\n      icon: \"⚠️\"\n    },\n    { \n      title: \"All Services Unavailable\", \n      description: \"Auth, Products, Cart, Payments, Shipping — everything stops working.\",\n      icon: \"🚫\"\n    },\n    { \n      title: \"Users Can't Access Anything\", \n      description: \"Complete service outage. Users see error pages everywhere.\",\n      icon: \"😱\"\n    }\n  ]}\n/>\n\nIn our example, the notification functionality had a problem, and because of it, the entire application is down.\n\nUnfortunately, this isn't the only problem with monolith applications...\n\n\u003CBeforeAfterCompare\n  before={{\n    title: \"Monolith Challenges\",\n    description: \"Issues that arise as the application grows\",\n    items: [\n      \"Scaling requires duplicating the entire app\",\n      \"Codebase grows exponentially\",\n      \"Single point of failure\",\n      \"Deployment = everything or nothing\"\n    ]\n  }}\n  after={{\n    title: \"What You Need\",\n    description: \"Ideal characteristics for large-scale systems\",\n    items: [\n      \"Scale only what needs scaling\",\n      \"Smaller, manageable codebases\",\n      \"Isolated failures\",\n      \"Independent deployments\"\n    ]\n  }}\n/>\n\n## The Present\n\nLooking at these problems, software architects wanted to find a better way to build software, so they came up with a solution.\n\nThe term \"microservices\" was coined in May 2011 during a software architects conference to represent a style of system architecture. The microservices-oriented architecture proposal is to develop systems that are more flexible, scalable, and simpler to maintain than monolithic architectures.\n\nBut the first question is: how exactly does it work?\n\n### Understanding microservices\n\nIn a microservices architecture, modules and functions are split apart. It's as if each service is a standalone application.

**completely independent**:\n- **Different technologies**: Each team chooses what works best (Node, Go, Python, Java, Rust, C#)\n- **Own database**: No shared state between services\n- **Isolated deployment**: Deploy one without touching others\n\n#### Observations\n\nMicroservices are occasionally misconstrued as Pattern-Oriented Software Architecture (POSA); however, it's essential to recognize that they are distinct concepts.\n\nThe company *RedHat* says this about it:\n\n> The main characteristic that differentiates them is scope: SOA is an architectural approach adopted by the enterprise as a whole, while microservices are an implementation strategy of the development team for each application.\n\nWith that in mind, let's continue.\n\n### Good Points\n\nA major advantage of microservices architecture is that if one microservice stops, the entire application doesn't break!\n\n\u003CFlowTimeline\n  title=\"When Notifications Break in Microservices...\"\n  steps={[\n    { \n      title: \"Notification Service Crashes\", \n      description: \"The notifications microservice encounters an error.\",\n      icon: \"💥\"\n    },\n    { \n      title: \"Other Services Keep Running\", \n      description: \"Auth, Products, Cart, Payments — all continue working normally.\",\n      icon: \"✅\"\n    },\n    { \n      title: \"Graceful Degradation\", \n      description: \"Users can still shop, pay, and use the app. Only notifications are delayed.\",\n      icon: \"🛡️\"\n    },\n    { \n      title: \"Easy Recovery\", \n      description: \"Ops team restarts just the notification service. No full redeploy needed.\",\n      icon: \"🔄\"\n    }\n  ]}\n/>\n\nHere we can see that if one of the microservices breaks, the others keep working. This is great because it brings us more consistency and reliability.\n\nMicroservices bring many benefits:\n\n\u003CBeforeAfterCompare\n  before={{\n    title: \"Monolith Limitations\",\n    description: \"What you're limited to with monolithic architecture\",\n    items: [\n      \"One massive codebase for everything\",\n      \"Complex code that's hard to understand\",\n      \"Deploy everything at once\",\n      \"Stuck with one programming language\"\n    ]\n  }}\n  after={{\n    title: \"Microservices Benefits\",\n    description: \"What microservices architecture enables\",\n    items: [\n      \"Smaller, focused codebases\",\n      \"Each service is easy to understand\",\n      \"Deploy services independently\",\n      \"Use the best language for each service\"\n    ]\n  }}\n/>\n\nAs you can see, microservices have many advantages and are used to some extent by almost every large tech company nowadays, since they provide many capabilities for organizations to scale their systems properly.\n\n### Bad Points\n\nUnfortunately, microservices aren't perfect. This software architecture has problems, so let's talk about some of them.\n\n\u003CFlowTimeline\n  title=\"Microservices Complexity\"\n  steps={[\n    { \n      title: \"Distributed System Challenges\", \n      description: \"Network calls can fail. Latency becomes a concern. Debugging across services is hard.\",\n      icon: \"🌐\"\n    },\n    { \n      title: \"Deployment Overhead\", \n      description: \"Each service needs its own CI/CD pipeline, monitoring, and infrastructure.\",\n      icon: \"🔧\"\n    },\n    { \n      title: \"Data Consistency\", \n      description: \"Keeping data in sync across services requires careful design (sagas, event sourcing).\",\n      icon: \"🔄\"\n    },\n    { \n      title: \"Increased Costs\", \n      description: \"More services = more servers, more monitoring, more operational complexity.\",\n      icon: \"💰\"\n    }\n  ]}\n/>\n\nMicroservices are usually complex. They need to be very well planned and executed because, if not, the software can become insecure, vulnerable, and hard to understand as a whole.\n\nThe truth is, microservices are excellent but can also be a shot in the foot.\n\n## The Future?\n\nSo, to finally answer the awaited question... **Which is better?**\n\nIn my opinion, it depends on the situation :)\n\n\u003CBeforeAfterCompare\n  before={{\n    title: \"Use Monolith When\",\n    description: \"Scenarios where monolith makes more sense\",\n    items: [\n      \"Small team (\u003C 10 developers)\",\n      \"Simple business logic\",\n      \"MVP or early-stage startup\",\n      \"Limited budget for infrastructure\"\n    ]\n  }}\n  after={{\n    title: \"Use Microservices When\",\n    description: \"Scenarios where microservices shine\",\n    items: [\n      \"Large team with multiple squads\",\n      \"Complex, evolving business rules\",\n      \"High scale requirements\",\n      \"Need for independent deployments\"\n    ]\n  }}\n/>\n\nWe, as developers, need to be smart when choosing one architecture over another. For example, it's not smart to use microservices architecture for a website for a small local store because the development will be slower, the website probably won't have complex business rules, and it will be more expensive.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIt's important to always be open-minded. Microservices have become mainstream in software development, but that doesn't mean we should only use them. There are other types of software architecture like Component-Based Architecture, Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA), Layered Architecture, and others.\n\nI think a good developer must understand when to use one or the other.\n\n---\n\nContact me and tell me what you think about this article!\n\nHope you liked it.","src/content/blog/en/monovsmicro.mdx","d14167bac4177264","en/monovsmicro.mdx",true,"en/websocket",{"id":49,"data":51,"body":56,"filePath":57,"digest":58,"rendered":59,"legacyId":86},{"title":52,"description":53,"publishDate":54,"image":55,"time":28,"draft":19},"What is a WebSocket","A clear explanation of WebSocket, how this protocol works and why it's used. If you want to understand real-time communication, click here!","Dec 11 2022","/blogg/websocket/websocketWallpaper.jpg","Some months ago I worked on some projects using this protocol, and in this article I'll share what I learned.\n\n## What is WebSocket and why is it used?\n\nWebSocket is a different way of handling communication on the web. Unlike HTTP, WebSocket doesn't follow the traditional \"request-response\" model. Instead, it provides bilateral communication, which gives us the ability to receive information from the server without explicitly requesting it.\n\n## How HTTP works\n\nLet's quickly understand how HTTP works to better appreciate WebSocket.\n\nIn HTTP, we need to make a request to receive a response. See the example below:\n\n![HTTP request-response model](/blogg/websocket/http.png)\n\nI asked for a website page, and it returned what I requested. Following the same logic, if I don't ask for anything, I won't receive anything!\n\nThis is where problems arise. Imagine building a real-time application with HTTP... We can't know when new information arrives on the server, and the client will only get updates if they explicitly ask for them. To achieve something close to real-time, we would need to make endless requests, even when there's nothing new to receive. That's a lot of constant requests just to check if something has changed.\n\n## Polling\n\nTo work around this problem, there's a technique called polling. It's when a system regularly checks another system for updates by sending periodic requests.\n\nThis technique was developed to achieve a near-real-time experience without consuming excessive computing resources.\n\n### Example\n\n![Polling example](/blogg/websocket/polling.png)\n\nIn this example, the client sends a request to the server every 30 seconds. When the server receives that request, it returns a response with any available updates.\n\n## How WebSocket works\n\nWebSocket brings us a solution for this type of problem. As I mentioned earlier, WebSocket doesn't follow the HTTP model of \"request and response\". Instead, it's like a tunnel of information — constantly sending and receiving.\n\nThe client doesn't have to \"ask\" for information to receive updates. The server sends them automatically. Both sides can communicate freely: client to server and server to client.\n\n![WebSocket bilateral communication](/blogg/websocket/websocket.png)\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWebSocket is an interesting protocol, but it's not appropriate for all cases. Developing with this protocol isn't the easiest thing to do, and you might lose performance in certain scenarios.

Following the same logic, if I don’t ask for anything, I won’t receive anything!\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>This is where problems arise. Imagine building a real-time application with HTTP… We can’t know when new information arrives on the server, and the client will only get updates if they explicitly ask for them. To achieve something close to real-time, we would need to make endless requests, even when there’s nothing new to receive. That’s a lot of constant requests just to check if something has changed.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"polling\">Polling\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>To work around this problem, there’s a technique called polling. It’s when a system regularly checks another system for updates by sending periodic requests.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>This technique was developed to achieve a near-real-time experience without consuming excessive computing resources.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"example\">Example\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"/blogg/websocket/polling.png\" alt=\"Polling example\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In this example, the client sends a request to the server every 30 seconds.

It's not about asking better questions — it's about giving better context. Here's how MCP is changing everything, and how I built a POC to prove it.","Dec 27 2025","/blogg/contextIsKing/context_is_king.jpg",10,"import InteractiveDiagram from '../../../components/mdx/InteractiveDiagram.astro';\nimport NetworkMesh from '../../../components/mdx/NetworkMesh.astro';\nimport BeforeAfterCompare from '../../../components/mdx/BeforeAfterCompare.astro';\nimport FlowTimeline from '../../../components/mdx/FlowTimeline.astro';\nimport Tooltip from '../../../components/mdx/Tooltip.tsx';\n\nAre you still using AI like a smarter Google? Asking questions and hoping for useful answers?\n\nI was too. And I was missing the point.\n\n## The Problem: AI Without Context\n\nLet me be honest: \u003CTooltip client:load content=\"Large Language Models - AI systems trained on massive amounts of text data to understand and generate human-like text\">ChatGPT, Claude, and other LLMs\u003C/Tooltip> are incredible. They can write code, explain complex topics, and help you think through problems. But there's a fundamental limitation that most people don't think about.\n\n**They know nothing about you.**\n\nThey don't know about your work. They don't know what meetings you have scheduled. They don't know what tasks are piling up on your to-do list. They don't know the codebase you're working on or the documents your team shares. They don't know about you.\n\nEvery company today has their own \"internal ChatGPT\". A wrapper with the company logo, integrated into Slack, answering questions about documentation...\n\nBut it only **answers**. And honestly? Not even that well — because it lacks your context. It doesn't **do** anything, and even when it tries to help, the answers are generic. Imagine an AI that not only answers *much better* because it knows your world, but also **acts** — and acts precisely.\n\n## The Shift: Context is King\n\nHere's what I've learned: the new way to use AI isn't about crafting better \u003CTooltip client:load content=\"Prompts are the instructions or questions you give to an AI. Prompt engineering is the practice of designing these instructions to get better outputs.\">prompts\u003C/Tooltip> or learning magic techniques. It's about giving AI access to your world.\n\nWhen AI has context about your environment — your emails, your calendar, your documents, your tools — something magical happens. It stops just *answering* and starts *acting*.\n\nInstead of asking \"How should I organize my emails?\" you can say \"Analyze my emails from today, summarize the important ones, and create tasks for anything that requires action.\"\n\nAnd it just... does it.\n\n\u003CBeforeAfterCompare \n  before={{\n    title: \"AI Without Context\",\n    description: \"Generic answers that apply to anyone\",\n    items: [\n      \"Copy-paste information manually\",\n      \"Adapt generic answers to your situation\",\n      \"Do the actual work yourself\",\n      \"AI as 'fancy autocomplete'\"\n    ]\n  }}\n  after={{\n    title: \"AI With Context\",\n    description: \"Personalized actions based on your world\",\n    items: [\n      \"AI understands your environment\",\n      \"Receives specific, actionable responses\",\n      \"Automates real tasks end-to-end\",\n      \"AI as true assistant\"\n    ]\n  }}\n/>\n\n## MCP: The Protocol Making This Possible\n\nIf you haven't heard about \u003CTooltip client:load content=\"Model Context Protocol - An open standard created by Anthropic that allows AI models to connect to external tools and data sources through a universal interface.\">MCP (Model Context Protocol)\u003C/Tooltip>, it's worth understanding. In simple terms, MCP is a standard way to connect AI models to external tools and data sources.\n\nThink about it: before MCP, every integration was custom. Want Claude to access your database? Write a plugin. Want it to send emails? Another plugin. Each one with its own API, authentication, data format.\n\nMCP standardizes all of this.\n\n\u003CFlowTimeline\n  title=\"How MCP Works\"\n  steps={[\n    { \n      title: \"1. Connection\", \n      description: \"The client connects to the MCP Server via SSE (Server-Sent Events) or stdio.\",\n      icon: \"🔌\"\n    },\n    { \n      title: \"2. Discovery\", \n      description: \"The client lists all available tools (tools/list).\",\n      icon: \"🔍\"\n    },\n    { \n      title: \"3.

Execution\", \n      description: \"The client executes the tool on the MCP Server and returns the result to the LLM.\",\n      icon: \"⚡\"\n    }\n  ]}\n/>\n\nThe key point here is: **the LLM decides which tool to use**. You just pass the list of available tools and it automatically chooses based on the conversation context.\n\nIn practice:\n- **Connect Gmail** → AI can read, search, summarize, and send your emails\n- **Connect Calendar** → AI can check availability, schedule meetings, and block time\n- **Connect Notion** → AI can create pages, update databases, and organize your notes\n- **Connect GitHub** → AI can review PRs, create issues, and check build status\n\nThink of it as a universal adapter. Instead of building custom integrations for every AI tool, MCP provides a common language. Any MCP-compatible client (like \u003CTooltip client:load content=\"Cursor is an AI-powered code editor that integrates AI directly into the development workflow. Claude Desktop is Anthropic's official desktop application for interacting with Claude.\">Cursor, Claude Desktop\u003C/Tooltip>, or custom agents) can connect to any MCP server and use its capabilities.\n\n> If you want to dive deeper into MCP, check out the [official documentation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) and the [Anthropic announcement](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol).\n\n## TrampoAI: From Theory to Practice\n\nTo understand how this works in practice, I built [TrampoAI](https://github.com/viniciusventura29/TrampoAI) — a complete MCP client with a chat interface.\n\n### Architecture\n\n```\n┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐\n│   React     │────▶│   Express   │────▶│   MCP Servers   │\n│   (Vite)    │◀────│   Backend   │◀────│   (via SSE)     │\n└─────────────┘     └──────┬──────┘     └─────────────────┘\n                           │\n                           ▼\n                    ┌─────────────┐\n                    │  Anthropic  │\n                    │    API      │\n                    └─────────────┘\n```\n\nThe flow is simple:\n\n1. **Frontend** sends a message to the backend\n2. **Backend** collects tools from all connected MCP Servers\n3. **Backend** sends message + tools to Anthropic API\n4. **Claude** responds with `tool_use` if it needs to execute something\n5. **Backend** executes the tool on the corresponding MCP Server\n6. **Backend** sends the `tool_result` back to Claude\n7. **Claude** generates the final response\n\n### Stack\n\n\u003Cdiv style=\"display: grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr); gap: 1rem; margin: 2rem 0;\">\n  \u003Cdiv style=\"padding: 1rem; background: #F5F2ED; border: 1px solid #2D3D3F;\">\n    \u003Cdiv style=\"font-family: 'IBM Plex Mono', monospace; font-size: 0.65rem; color: #5A5A5A; letter-spacing: 0.15em; margin-bottom: 0.25rem;\">FRONTEND\u003C/div>\n    \u003Cdiv style=\"font-family: 'IBM Plex Mono', monospace; font-size: 0.85rem; color: #0D5C4B; font-weight: 500;\">React 18 + Vite + TypeScript\u003C/div>\n  \u003C/div>\n  \u003Cdiv style=\"padding: 1rem; background: #F5F2ED; border: 1px solid #2D3D3F;\">\n    \u003Cdiv style=\"font-family: 'IBM Plex Mono', monospace; font-size: 0.65rem; color: #5A5A5A; letter-spacing: 0.15em; margin-bottom: 0.25rem;\">BACKEND\u003C/div>\n    \u003Cdiv style=\"font-family: 'IBM Plex Mono', monospace; font-size: 0.85rem; color: #0D5C4B; font-weight: 500;\">Express + TypeScript\u003C/div>\n  \u003C/div>\n  \u003Cdiv style=\"padding: 1rem; background: #F5F2ED; border: 1px solid #2D3D3F;\">\n    \u003Cdiv style=\"font-family: 'IBM Plex Mono', monospace; font-size: 0.65rem; color: #5A5A5A; letter-spacing: 0.15em; margin-bottom: 0.25rem;\">MCP SDK\u003C/div>\n    \u003Cdiv style=\"font-family: 'IBM Plex Mono', monospace; font-size: 0.85rem; color: #0D5C4B; font-weight: 500;\">@modelcontextprotocol/sdk\u003C/div>\n  \u003C/div>\n  \u003Cdiv style=\"padding: 1rem; background: #F5F2ED; border: 1px solid #2D3D3F;\">\n    \u003Cdiv style=\"font-family: 'IBM Plex Mono', monospace; font-size: 0.65rem; color: #5A5A5A; letter-spacing: 0.15em; margin-bottom: 0.25rem;\">LLM\u003C/div>\n    \u003Cdiv style=\"font-family: 'IBM Plex Mono', monospace; font-size: 0.85rem; color: #0D5C4B; font-weight: 500;\">Claude Sonnet 4\u003C/div>\n  \u003C/div>\n  \u003Cdiv style=\"padding: 1rem; background: #F5F2ED; border: 1px solid #2D3D3F;\">\n    \u003Cdiv style=\"font-family: 'IBM Plex Mono', monospace; font-size: 0.65rem; color: #5A5A5A; letter-spacing: 0.15em; margin-bottom: 0.25rem;\">STYLING\u003C/div>\n    \u003Cdiv style=\"font-family: 'IBM Plex Mono', monospace; font-size: 0.85rem; color: #0D5C4B; font-weight: 500;\">Tailwind CSS\u003C/div>\n  \u003C/div>\n  \u003Cdiv style=\"padding: 1rem; background: #F5F2ED; border: 1px solid #2D3D3F;\">\n    \u003Cdiv style=\"font-family: 'IBM Plex Mono', monospace; font-size: 0.65rem; color: #5A5A5A; letter-spacing: 0.15em; margin-bottom: 0.25rem;\">ICONS\u003C/div>\n    \u003Cdiv style=\"font-family: 'IBM Plex Mono', monospace; font-size: 0.85rem; color: #0D5C4B; font-weight: 500;\">Lucide Icons\u003C/div>\n  \u003C/div>\n\u003C/div>\n\n### Demo: One Prompt, Four Tools\n\nHere's TrampoAI in action.

Called the **Gmail MCP** to read my emails\n2. Summarized and filtered which ones needed action\n3. Called the **Notion MCP** to create tasks\n4. Called the **Google Calendar MCP** to block time\n\nNo manual orchestration. No hardcoded workflows. The LLM figured out which tools to use and in what order.\n\nThis is the difference between AI that *informs* and AI that *acts*. I didn't ask for information. I asked for action. And because the AI had context about my email, my calendar, and my task management system, it could actually deliver.\n\n## The Scaling Problem: MCP Mess\n\nOk, it works. But what happens when you have **10 MCP Servers**? **50**? **100**?\n\n\u003CBeforeAfterCompare\n  before={{\n    title: \"Naive MCP\",\n    description: \"Each client connects to each MCP Server\",\n    items: [\n      \"N clients × M servers = N×M connections\",\n      \"Each client manages its own credentials\",\n      \"No centralized access control\",\n      \"No unified observability\"\n    ]\n  }}\n  after={{\n    title: \"The Problem\",\n    description: \"This doesn't scale\",\n    items: [\n      \"Connection explosion\",\n      \"Scattered credentials\",\n      \"Who accessed what?\",\n      \"How much are we spending?\"\n    ]\n  }}\n/>\n\nBuilding TrampoAI, I realized in practice: **managing multiple MCP Servers is a nightmare**.\n\nEach server has its own connection, its own tools, its own credentials. There's no way to know who executed what, how much it cost, if someone is abusing the system.\n\n## The Solution: MCP Mesh\n\nThis is where [Deco's MCP Mesh](https://www.decocms.com/mesh) comes in.\n\nThe idea is simple: instead of each client connecting directly to each MCP Server, you have a **control plane** in the middle.\n\nAnd honestly? Setting it up was **ridiculously easy**. I ran the Deco project locally, opened their MCP store, clicked to authenticate the MCPs I wanted (Gmail, Notion, Calendar), selected the tools I needed, and exported everything as a single link — that's the mesh. That one URL is what I used in TrampoAI. No manual configuration for each server. No credential juggling. Just click, authenticate, export. Done.\n\n\u003CInteractiveDiagram \n  title=\"MCP Mesh Architecture\"\n  nodes={[\n    { id: \"clients\", label: \"Clients\", icon: \"💻\" },\n    { id: \"mesh\", label: \"MCP Mesh\", icon: \"🔀\" },\n    { id: \"servers\", label: \"MCP Servers\", icon: \"⚙️\" }\n  ]}\n/>\n\nMCP Mesh provides:\n\n### 1. One Endpoint for Everything\n\nNo matter how many MCP Servers you have. Your clients connect to **a single endpoint**. The Mesh routes to the right tools.\n\n### 2. RBAC and Policies\n\nAccess control at the control plane level. Who can use which tool? Does it need approval to execute? All configurable.\n\n### 3. Observability\n\nUnified logs for all executions. Latency, errors, costs — all in one place.\n\n### 4. Smart Routing\n\nWhen you have many tools, sending all of them to the LLM gets expensive (tokens) and slow. The Mesh has intelligent selection strategies.\n\n### 5. No Vendor Lock-in\n\nOpen-source, self-hosted. Runs on your Kubernetes, on your infrastructure. You're in control.\n\n```bash\n# Run locally in 1 minute\nnpx @decocms/mesh\n```\n\nI work at Deco, so I'm obviously biased. But I genuinely believe this is the direction things are going. As MCP adoption grows, the need for proper infrastructure to manage it becomes critical — just like how APIs needed \u003CTooltip client:load content=\"An API Gateway is a server that acts as a single entry point for multiple backend services, handling authentication, rate limiting, and routing.\">API gateways\u003C/Tooltip>, MCP needs its own management layer.\n\n## A Glimpse of the Future\n\nLet me share something I've been thinking about a lot.\n\nI imagine a future where everyone has their own personal MCP mesh — a web of connections to all your contexts, your information, your tools, your life. And alongside it, your own AI agent. Not a product you use. A companion that *knows you*.\n\nThink about it: you're walking around, talking to your AI about an idea you just had. You tell it to save a note. You ask about that message your friend sent yesterday. You wonder out loud what your week looks like, and it just *tells you* — because it knows. It has access to everything you've given it permission to see.\n\nYour emails, your calendar, your notes, your messages, your documents, your photos, your music, your finances — all connected, all contextual, all *yours*.\n\nThis isn't science fiction. The pieces are already here. MCP is the protocol. The mesh is the infrastructure. The agents are getting smarter every day. What's missing is just time — and adoption.\n\nI truly believe we're heading toward a world where your AI isn't just a tool you open when you need something. It's always there, always aware of your context, always ready to help. Like having a brilliant friend who never forgets anything and is genuinely trying to make your life easier.\n\nThat's the future I'm excited about. And honestly? We're closer than most people think.\n\n## What I Learned\n\nBuilding TrampoAI was real proof of how things work under the hood.\n\n\u003CFlowTimeline\n  title=\"Key Takeaways\"\n  steps={[\n    { \n      title: \"MCP is simple\", \n      description: \"The protocol itself is elegant. SSE + JSON-RPC. Easy to implement.\",\n      icon: \"✅\"\n    },\n    { \n      title: \"Context changes everything\", \n      description: \"A smaller model with your context beats a bigger model without it.\",\n      icon: \"🎯\"\n    },\n    { \n      title: \"Managing is complex\", \n      description: \"Multiple servers, credentials, connections... quickly becomes chaos.\",\n      icon: \"⚠️\"\n    },\n    { \n      title: \"You need a Mesh\", \n      description: \"For production, you need a control plane. Simple as that.\",\n      icon: \"🔀\"\n    }\n  ]}\n/>\n\n## Conclusion\n\nHere's my take: the next leap in AI usefulness won't come from bigger models or better training. It will come from better context.\n\nA model with perfect knowledge and zero context about your life is less useful than a smaller model that knows exactly what you're working on, what you need to do, and what tools you have available.\n\nWe're moving from \"AI as oracle\" to \"AI as assistant.\" An oracle answers questions. An assistant knows your world and acts within it.\n\n**Your AI is only as useful as the context you give it.**\n\n---\n\nIf you want to understand how this works in practice, check out [TrampoAI](https://github.com/viniciusventura29/TrampoAI). It's open-source and you can run it locally in 5 minutes.\n\nAnd if you want to explore contextual AI yourself, start small. Pick one tool you use daily — maybe your calendar or your notes app — and find an MCP server for it. Connect it to your AI client and see what becomes possible.\n\nThe shift from generic to contextual AI isn't coming. It's already here.\n\nLet me know what you think on my socials.

For a long time.\n\nI worked at Mercado Livre — a billion-dollar multinational, huge company, well-structured, full of opportunities. It was great. There was a world to discover, to learn. Good salary. Family. Everything.\n\nBut something was always missing inside me.\n\nI had low motivation to work. It wasn't that the job was bad — it was that I didn't feel complete. Like I was doing the right thing, but not *my* thing.\n\nAnd then came the guilt: how could I be sad? Why would I be unsatisfied? In my head, I couldn't complain about my life because there were people in much worse situations than mine.\n\nI went through many sleepless nights during this phase. I would fall into a loop. And therapy helped me understand that this logic is a trap — the fact that there are people in worse situations doesn't invalidate what you feel. Your discomfort is real. Your dissatisfaction is valid. Ignoring it only sinks you deeper.\n\n---\n\nIt was in this context that I received an offer from Deco.\n\nWe had about 4 or 5 meetings before I decided to accept. And in the first one, they asked me a question that caught me completely off guard:\n\n> **\"What do you want from your life?\"**\n\nSuch a simple question. So direct. And so hard to answer.\n\nBut I knew. And I still know. **I want to build something amazing.** Not something generic. Not something just to pay the bills. Something I can look at and see myself in. \"I am here.\" As if I belonged to that place.\n\n---\n\nThat question forced me to confront something I had been avoiding: who defines what I should want? Where does this life script I was following without questioning come from?\n\nNietzsche has a phrase that always made me think:\n\n\u003CQuote \n  text=\"God is dead. God remains dead. And we have killed him.\"\n/>\n\nThis isn't a religious statement — and I don't want to get into that discussion. What Nietzsche was pointing to is something deeper: absolute values, those unquestionable truths that guided society, have lost their power. And that left a void.\n\nBut with that void comes responsibility. If there's no longer a pre-defined guide telling you what's right, what's wrong, what the meaning of life is... then it's up to *you* to create it.\n\nNietzsche wasn't celebrating this \"death.\" He was warning about the immense challenge of building new purposes without a ready-made script. It's much easier to follow a manual. Do what everyone else does. Accept the values handed to you ready-made.\n\nBut it's also liberating. Because if you're responsible for creating your meaning... then you can create a meaning that actually makes sense *to you*.\n\n---\n\nAnd that's exactly what I did. I stopped accepting ready-made truths.\n\nI used to hear a lot in my bubble things like \"you have to work hard while you're young to have financial freedom when you're older and be able to do what you want.\" And for a long time I accepted this as truth.\n\nUntil one day I asked myself: **but why can't I do what I want now? Why do I have to be old for that?**\n\nFrom that, I thought: \"What would I do if I were a super rich old man?\" And I want to go to that place. Now. Not 30 years from now.\n\n\u003CQuote \n  text=\"If you're not doing today what you would do as a super rich old person, maybe it's time to rethink your choices.\"\n  highlight={true}\n/>\n\nFortunately, I think I'm already where I'd like to be. If I weren't doing what I currently do, I'd be very close to it. This mental exercise helps me calibrate whether I'm on the right path.\n\n---\n\nFor a long time, I silenced my desires. Out of fear. Out of insecurity. Fear of being judged. Fear of not being supported.\n\nThis job change was one of those cases. And by doing it — by finally choosing what made sense to me — something changed inside me. More and more things are emerging. The desire to publish more of what I think and am. To expose myself more to the world. To connect with more people. To talk. To discuss. To expose myself to error. To err and learn. To redo.\n\nI think this is one of my principles and life purposes:\n\n\u003CQuote \n  text=\"To live.\"\n  highlight={true}\n/>\n\nSimply live. Do. Experiment. Fail. Correct. Move on.\n\n---\n\nHere's what I learned: if your work aligns with your life's purpose, motivation becomes a powerful weapon for success. When you have passion, the drive to do what you do, things flow much better. Your productivity is better. The quality of your delivery is better. Your satisfaction is better. Your life is better. Because you do what makes sense to you.\n\nToday I have the privilege of working with what I love. And I say privilege because, unfortunately, that's exactly what it is — a privilege. I wish everyone could work with what excites them. That would certainly make the world much better. But our reality is harsh and cruel. Not everyone has that choice.\n\nThis way, I believe there's no way to go wrong. I know that in the future I won't regret it — because I'm consciously and daily choosing to live the life I want to live.\n\n---\n\nIf you're in a place where everything seems right but something feels wrong — pay attention to that. That discomfort is information.\n\nPurpose isn't something you find ready-made. It's something you build. And sometimes, the answer comes from unexpected places. A question in an interview. A conversation with someone who thinks differently. A discomfort you finally decide to stop ignoring.\n\nToday I wake up wanting to work. Not every day — let's be honest. But most of them. And that, for me, changed everything.\n\nI'm not a guru. I don't hold any special wisdom. I'm just a 21-year-old who went through this, lived it firsthand, and drew these reflections. Maybe in 10 years I'll look at this text and disagree with everything. But this is what I think today — and I thought it was worth sharing.\n\nIf you're on this journey of seeking purpose, good luck. It's a journey worth taking.\n\nAnd if you want to chat, hit me up on socials. I love talking about these things.","src/content/blog/en/purpose.mdx","e11091924a578869","en/purpose.mdx","pt/hello",{"id":111,"data":113,"body":116,"filePath":117,"digest":118,"rendered":119,"legacyId":130},{"title":14,"description":114,"publishDate":16,"image":17,"time":18,"draft":19,"translationKey":115},"Bem-vindo ao meu site/blog pessoal!","hello","## Bem-vindo!\n\nEste é meu blog pessoal! 🤩\n\nAqui pretendo escrever sobre algumas coisas interessantes do mundo da tecnologia.\n\nSou um jovem desenvolvedor de software e web que ama aprender novas tecnologias.

Isso é normal.\n\nO problema real é quando as pessoas tomam partido e só veem uma perspectiva.\n\nIsso acontece muito!\n\nEu estava no Twitter e vi uma grande thread de discussão sobre **Qual é melhor: monolito ou microsserviços?**\n\nEntão, este artigo é para compartilhar minha opinião sobre o tema.\n\n## O Início\n\nAntes desse tipo de discussão existir, já havia uma forma de construir aplicações, e essa forma se chama *Monolito*.\n\nO Monolito foi concebido primeiro porque, na maioria das vezes, é uma arquitetura mais simples (embora nem sempre seja o caso). Vamos entender o que exatamente é um projeto *monolito*:\n\n### Entendendo um monolito\n\n\u003CInteractiveDiagram \n  title=\"Arquitetura Monolito E-commerce\"\n  nodes={[\n    { id: \"frontend\", label: \"Frontend\", icon: \"🖥️\" },\n    { id: \"backend\", label: \"Backend (API)\", icon: \"⚙️\" },\n    { id: \"database\", label: \"Banco de Dados\", icon: \"🗄️\" }\n  ]}\n/>\n\nEste é um exemplo de uma aplicação de e-commerce. Para explicar melhor o que está acontecendo, temos este e-commerce dividido em três partes:\n- **Frontend**: o que o usuário final vê e interage\n- **Backend**: onde toda a lógica da aplicação vive\n- **Banco de Dados**: onde todos os dados e informações do nosso e-commerce são armazenados\n\nEntão, este é um sistema único com todos os módulos e funcionalidades dentro dele. Um projeto, uma base de código, um banco de dados, uma linguagem de programação!\n\n### Pontos Positivos\n\nEssa singularidade nos traz muitas vantagens:\n\n\u003CBeforeAfterCompare\n  before={{\n    title: \"Sem Monolito\",\n    description: \"Desenvolvimento disperso sem estrutura unificada\",\n    items: [\n      \"Múltiplas bases de código para gerenciar\",\n      \"Padrões diferentes em cada serviço\",\n      \"Orquestração de deploy complexa\",\n      \"Fragmentação de tecnologia\"\n    ]\n  }}\n  after={{\n    title: \"Com Monolito\",\n    description: \"Desenvolvimento unificado com estrutura consistente\",\n    items: [\n      \"Um repositório, uma base de código\",\n      \"Padrões e lógica consistentes\",\n      \"Um pipeline de deploy\",\n      \"Ciclo de desenvolvimento rápido\"\n    ]\n  }}\n/>\n\nMonolito tem muitos pontos positivos.\n\n---\n\nImagine que nosso e-commerce tem todas essas funcionalidades:\n\n\u003CInteractiveDiagram \n  title=\"Funcionalidades do E-commerce (Tudo em Um)\"\n  nodes={[\n    { id: \"auth\", label: \"Auth\", icon: \"🔐\" },\n    { id: \"products\", label: \"Produtos\", icon: \"📦\" },\n    { id: \"cart\", label: \"Carrinho\", icon: \"🛒\" },\n    { id: \"payments\", label: \"Pagamentos\", icon: \"💳\" },\n    { id: \"notifications\", label: \"Notificações\", icon: \"🔔\" },\n    { id: \"shipping\", label: \"Envio\", icon: \"🚚\" }\n  ]}\n/>\n\nÉ uma ótima aplicação, certo? Temos muitas funcionalidades acopladas juntas, e isso nos leva ao primeiro problema dos monolitos...\n\n### Pontos Negativos\n\nComo eu disse, todas as funcionalidades são altamente acopladas, o que significa que se uma funcionalidade quebrar, todas as outras quebram também.\n\n\u003CFlowTimeline\n  title=\"Quando Notificações Quebram...\"\n  steps={[\n    { \n      title: \"Serviço de Notificação Crasha\", \n      description: \"Uma exceção não tratada ocorre no módulo de notificações.\",\n      icon: \"💥\"\n    },\n    { \n      title: \"Backend Cai\", \n      description: \"Como tudo está no mesmo processo, todo o backend crasha.\",\n      icon: \"⚠️\"\n    },\n    { \n      title: \"Todos os Serviços Indisponíveis\", \n      description: \"Auth, Produtos, Carrinho, Pagamentos, Envio — tudo para de funcionar.\",\n      icon: \"🚫\"\n    },\n    { \n      title: \"Usuários Não Conseguem Acessar Nada\", \n      description: \"Queda completa do serviço. Usuários veem páginas de erro em todo lugar.\",\n      icon: \"😱\"\n    }\n  ]}\n/>\n\nNo nosso exemplo, a funcionalidade de notificação teve um problema, e por causa disso, toda a aplicação está fora do ar.\n\nInfelizmente, este não é o único problema com aplicações monolíticas...\n\n\u003CBeforeAfterCompare\n  before={{\n    title: \"Desafios do Monolito\",\n    description: \"Problemas que surgem conforme a aplicação cresce\",\n    items: [\n      \"Escalar requer duplicar toda a aplicação\",\n      \"Base de código cresce exponencialmente\",\n      \"Ponto único de falha\",\n      \"Deploy = tudo ou nada\"\n    ]\n  }}\n  after={{\n    title: \"O Que Você Precisa\",\n    description: \"Características ideais para sistemas de grande escala\",\n    items: [\n      \"Escalar apenas o que precisa\",\n      \"Bases de código menores e gerenciáveis\",\n      \"Falhas isoladas\",\n      \"Deploys independentes\"\n    ]\n  }}\n/>\n\n## O Presente\n\nOlhando para esses problemas, arquitetos de software queriam encontrar uma forma melhor de construir software, então eles criaram uma solução.\n\nO termo \"microsserviços\" foi cunhado em maio de 2011 durante uma conferência de arquitetos de software para representar um estilo de arquitetura de sistemas. A proposta da arquitetura orientada a microsserviços é desenvolver sistemas que são mais flexíveis, escaláveis e mais simples de manter do que arquiteturas monolíticas.\n\nMas a primeira pergunta é: como exatamente funciona?\n\n### Entendendo microsserviços\n\nEm uma arquitetura de microsserviços, módulos e funções são separados. É como se cada serviço fosse uma aplicação independente.

**Banco próprio**: Sem estado compartilhado entre serviços\n- **Deploy isolado**: Deploy de um sem tocar nos outros\n\n#### Observações\n\nMicrosserviços são ocasionalmente confundidos com Pattern-Oriented Software Architecture (POSA); entretanto, é essencial reconhecer que são conceitos distintos.\n\nA empresa *RedHat* diz isso sobre o assunto:\n\n> A principal característica que os diferencia é o escopo: SOA é uma abordagem arquitetural adotada pela empresa como um todo, enquanto microsserviços são uma estratégia de implementação do time de desenvolvimento para cada aplicação.\n\nCom isso em mente, vamos continuar.\n\n### Pontos Positivos\n\nUma grande vantagem da arquitetura de microsserviços é que se um microsserviço parar, a aplicação inteira não quebra!\n\n\u003CFlowTimeline\n  title=\"Quando Notificações Quebram em Microsserviços...\"\n  steps={[\n    { \n      title: \"Serviço de Notificação Crasha\", \n      description: \"O microsserviço de notificações encontra um erro.\",\n      icon: \"💥\"\n    },\n    { \n      title: \"Outros Serviços Continuam Rodando\", \n      description: \"Auth, Produtos, Carrinho, Pagamentos — todos continuam funcionando normalmente.\",\n      icon: \"✅\"\n    },\n    { \n      title: \"Degradação Graciosa\", \n      description: \"Usuários ainda podem comprar, pagar e usar o app. Apenas notificações estão atrasadas.\",\n      icon: \"🛡️\"\n    },\n    { \n      title: \"Recuperação Fácil\", \n      description: \"Time de Ops reinicia apenas o serviço de notificação. Sem redeploy completo.\",\n      icon: \"🔄\"\n    }\n  ]}\n/>\n\nAqui podemos ver que se um dos microsserviços quebrar, os outros continuam funcionando. Isso é ótimo porque nos traz mais consistência e confiabilidade.\n\nMicrosserviços trazem muitos benefícios:\n\n\u003CBeforeAfterCompare\n  before={{\n    title: \"Limitações do Monolito\",\n    description: \"A que você está limitado com arquitetura monolítica\",\n    items: [\n      \"Uma base de código massiva para tudo\",\n      \"Código complexo difícil de entender\",\n      \"Deploy de tudo de uma vez\",\n      \"Preso a uma linguagem de programação\"\n    ]\n  }}\n  after={{\n    title: \"Benefícios dos Microsserviços\",\n    description: \"O que a arquitetura de microsserviços possibilita\",\n    items: [\n      \"Bases de código menores e focadas\",\n      \"Cada serviço é fácil de entender\",\n      \"Deploy de serviços independentemente\",\n      \"Usar a melhor linguagem para cada serviço\"\n    ]\n  }}\n/>\n\nComo você pode ver, microsserviços têm muitas vantagens e são usados até certo ponto por quase todas as grandes empresas de tecnologia hoje em dia, já que fornecem muitas capacidades para organizações escalarem seus sistemas adequadamente.\n\n### Pontos Negativos\n\nInfelizmente, microsserviços não são perfeitos. Essa arquitetura de software tem problemas, então vamos falar sobre alguns deles.\n\n\u003CFlowTimeline\n  title=\"Complexidade dos Microsserviços\"\n  steps={[\n    { \n      title: \"Desafios de Sistema Distribuído\", \n      description: \"Chamadas de rede podem falhar. Latência se torna uma preocupação. Debug entre serviços é difícil.\",\n      icon: \"🌐\"\n    },\n    { \n      title: \"Overhead de Deploy\", \n      description: \"Cada serviço precisa de seu próprio pipeline CI/CD, monitoramento e infraestrutura.\",\n      icon: \"🔧\"\n    },\n    { \n      title: \"Consistência de Dados\", \n      description: \"Manter dados sincronizados entre serviços requer design cuidadoso (sagas, event sourcing).\",\n      icon: \"🔄\"\n    },\n    { \n      title: \"Custos Aumentados\", \n      description: \"Mais serviços = mais servidores, mais monitoramento, mais complexidade operacional.\",\n      icon: \"💰\"\n    }\n  ]}\n/>\n\nMicrosserviços geralmente são complexos. Eles precisam ser muito bem planejados e executados porque, se não, o software pode se tornar inseguro, vulnerável e difícil de entender como um todo.\n\nA verdade é que microsserviços são excelentes mas também podem ser um tiro no pé.\n\n## O Futuro?\n\nEntão, para finalmente responder a pergunta esperada... **Qual é melhor?**\n\nNa minha opinião, depende da situação :)\n\n\u003CBeforeAfterCompare\n  before={{\n    title: \"Use Monolito Quando\",\n    description: \"Cenários onde monolito faz mais sentido\",\n    items: [\n      \"Time pequeno (\u003C 10 desenvolvedores)\",\n      \"Lógica de negócio simples\",\n      \"MVP ou startup em estágio inicial\",\n      \"Orçamento limitado para infraestrutura\"\n    ]\n  }}\n  after={{\n    title: \"Use Microsserviços Quando\",\n    description: \"Cenários onde microsserviços brilham\",\n    items: [\n      \"Time grande com múltiplos squads\",\n      \"Regras de negócio complexas e em evolução\",\n      \"Requisitos de alta escala\",\n      \"Necessidade de deploys independentes\"\n    ]\n  }}\n/>\n\nNós, como desenvolvedores, precisamos ser inteligentes ao escolher uma arquitetura sobre outra. Por exemplo, não é inteligente usar arquitetura de microsserviços para um site de uma pequena loja local porque o desenvolvimento será mais lento, o site provavelmente não terá regras de negócio complexas, e será mais caro.\n\n## Conclusão\n\nÉ importante sempre ter a mente aberta. Microsserviços se tornaram mainstream no desenvolvimento de software, mas isso não significa que devemos usar apenas eles. Existem outros tipos de arquitetura de software como Component-Based Architecture, Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA), Layered Architecture, e outros.\n\nEu acho que um bom desenvolvedor deve entender quando usar um ou outro.\n\n---\n\nEntre em contato e me diga o que você acha deste artigo!\n\nEspero que tenha gostado.","src/content/blog/pt/monovsmicro.mdx","1ace7a91014bc942","pt/monovsmicro.mdx","pt/contextisking",{"id":175,"data":177,"body":181,"filePath":182,"digest":183,"legacyId":184,"deferredRender":48},{"title":178,"description":179,"publishDate":92,"image":93,"time":94,"draft":19,"translationKey":180},"Contexto é Rei: A Nova Forma de Usar IA","Estávamos usando IA errado.

Fazendo perguntas e esperando respostas úteis?\n\nEu estava também. E estava perdendo o ponto.\n\n## O Problema: IA Sem Contexto\n\nVou ser honesto: \u003CTooltip client:load content=\"Large Language Models - Sistemas de IA treinados em quantidades massivas de texto para entender e gerar texto similar ao humano\">ChatGPT, Claude e outros LLMs\u003C/Tooltip> são incríveis. Eles podem escrever código, explicar tópicos complexos e ajudar você a pensar em problemas. Mas há uma limitação fundamental que a maioria das pessoas não pensa.\n\n**Eles não sabem nada sobre você.**\n\nEles não sabem sobre seu trabalho. Não sabem que reuniões você tem agendadas. Não sabem que tarefas estão se acumulando na sua lista de afazeres. Não conhecem o codebase em que você está trabalhando ou os documentos que seu time compartilha. Eles não sabem sobre você.\n\nToda empresa hoje tem seu próprio \"ChatGPT interno\". Um wrapper com o logo da empresa, integrado no Slack, respondendo perguntas sobre documentação...\n\nMas ele só **responde**. E honestamente? Nem bem — porque falta contexto. Ele não **faz** nada, e mesmo quando tenta ajudar, as respostas são genéricas. Imagine uma IA que não só responde *muito melhor* porque conhece seu mundo, mas também **age** — e age com precisão.\n\n## A Mudança: Contexto é Rei\n\nAqui está o que aprendi: a nova forma de usar IA não é sobre criar \u003CTooltip client:load content=\"Prompts são as instruções ou perguntas que você dá a uma IA. Engenharia de prompt é a prática de projetar essas instruções para obter melhores outputs.\">prompts\u003C/Tooltip> melhores ou aprender técnicas mágicas. É sobre dar à IA acesso ao seu mundo.\n\nQuando a IA tem contexto sobre seu ambiente — seus emails, seu calendário, seus documentos, suas ferramentas — algo mágico acontece. Ela para de apenas *responder* e começa a *agir*.\n\nEm vez de perguntar \"Como devo organizar meus emails?\" você pode dizer \"Analise meus emails de hoje, resuma os importantes e crie tarefas para qualquer coisa que precise de ação.\"\n\nE ela simplesmente... faz.\n\n\u003CBeforeAfterCompare \n  before={{\n    title: \"IA Sem Contexto\",\n    description: \"Respostas genéricas que servem para qualquer um\",\n    items: [\n      \"Copiar-colar informações manualmente\",\n      \"Adaptar respostas genéricas para sua situação\",\n      \"Fazer o trabalho real você mesmo\",\n      \"IA como 'autocomplete chique'\"\n    ]\n  }}\n  after={{\n    title: \"IA Com Contexto\",\n    description: \"Ações personalizadas baseadas no seu mundo\",\n    items: [\n      \"IA entende seu ambiente\",\n      \"Recebe respostas específicas e acionáveis\",\n      \"Automatiza tarefas reais de ponta a ponta\",\n      \"IA como verdadeiro assistente\"\n    ]\n  }}\n/>\n\n## MCP: O Protocolo Tornando Isso Possível\n\nSe você não ouviu falar do \u003CTooltip client:load content=\"Model Context Protocol - Um padrão aberto criado pela Anthropic que permite modelos de IA se conectarem a ferramentas externas e fontes de dados através de uma interface universal.\">MCP (Model Context Protocol)\u003C/Tooltip>, vale a pena entender. Em termos simples, MCP é uma forma padrão de conectar modelos de IA a ferramentas externas e fontes de dados.\n\nPense nisso: antes do MCP, toda integração era customizada. Quer que o Claude acesse seu banco de dados? Escreva um plugin. Quer que ele envie emails? Outro plugin. Cada um com sua própria API, autenticação, formato de dados.\n\nO MCP padroniza tudo isso.\n\n\u003CFlowTimeline\n  title=\"Como o MCP Funciona\"\n  steps={[\n    { \n      title: \"1. Conexão\", \n      description: \"O cliente se conecta ao MCP Server via SSE (Server-Sent Events) ou stdio.\",\n      icon: \"🔌\"\n    },\n    { \n      title: \"2.

Execução\", \n      description: \"O cliente executa a ferramenta no MCP Server e retorna o resultado ao LLM.\",\n      icon: \"⚡\"\n    }\n  ]}\n/>\n\nO ponto chave aqui é: **o LLM decide qual ferramenta usar**. Você apenas passa a lista de ferramentas disponíveis e ele automaticamente escolhe baseado no contexto da conversa.\n\nNa prática:\n- **Conecte Gmail** → IA pode ler, pesquisar, resumir e enviar seus emails\n- **Conecte Calendário** → IA pode verificar disponibilidade, agendar reuniões e bloquear horários\n- **Conecte Notion** → IA pode criar páginas, atualizar bancos de dados e organizar suas notas\n- **Conecte GitHub** → IA pode revisar PRs, criar issues e verificar status de builds\n\nPense nisso como um adaptador universal. Em vez de construir integrações customizadas para cada ferramenta de IA, o MCP fornece uma linguagem comum. Qualquer cliente compatível com MCP (como \u003CTooltip client:load content=\"Cursor é um editor de código alimentado por IA que integra IA diretamente no fluxo de desenvolvimento. Claude Desktop é a aplicação desktop oficial da Anthropic para interagir com o Claude.\">Cursor, Claude Desktop\u003C/Tooltip>, ou agentes customizados) pode se conectar a qualquer servidor MCP e usar suas capacidades.\n\n> Se você quiser se aprofundar no MCP, confira a [documentação oficial](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) e o [anúncio da Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol).\n\n## TrampoAI: Da Teoria à Prática\n\nPara entender como isso funciona na prática, construí o [TrampoAI](https://github.com/viniciusventura29/TrampoAI) — um cliente MCP completo com interface de chat.\n\n### Arquitetura\n\n```\n┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐\n│   React     │────▶│   Express   │────▶│   MCP Servers   │\n│   (Vite)    │◀────│   Backend   │◀────│   (via SSE)     │\n└─────────────┘     └──────┬──────┘     └─────────────────┘\n                           │\n                           ▼\n                    ┌─────────────┐\n                    │  Anthropic  │\n                    │    API      │\n                    └─────────────┘\n```\n\nO fluxo é simples:\n\n1. **Frontend** envia uma mensagem para o backend\n2. **Backend** coleta ferramentas de todos os MCP Servers conectados\n3. **Backend** envia mensagem + ferramentas para a API da Anthropic\n4. **Claude** responde com `tool_use` se precisar executar algo\n5. **Backend** executa a ferramenta no MCP Server correspondente\n6. **Backend** envia o `tool_result` de volta para o Claude\n7. **Claude** gera a resposta final\n\n### Stack\n\n\u003Cdiv style=\"display: grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr); gap: 1rem; margin: 2rem 0;\">\n  \u003Cdiv style=\"padding: 1rem; background: #F5F2ED; border: 1px solid #2D3D3F;\">\n    \u003Cdiv style=\"font-family: 'IBM Plex Mono', monospace; font-size: 0.65rem; color: #5A5A5A; letter-spacing: 0.15em; margin-bottom: 0.25rem;\">FRONTEND\u003C/div>\n    \u003Cdiv style=\"font-family: 'IBM Plex Mono', monospace; font-size: 0.85rem; color: #0D5C4B; font-weight: 500;\">React 18 + Vite + TypeScript\u003C/div>\n  \u003C/div>\n  \u003Cdiv style=\"padding: 1rem; background: #F5F2ED; border: 1px solid #2D3D3F;\">\n    \u003Cdiv style=\"font-family: 'IBM Plex Mono', monospace; font-size: 0.65rem; color: #5A5A5A; letter-spacing: 0.15em; margin-bottom: 0.25rem;\">BACKEND\u003C/div>\n    \u003Cdiv style=\"font-family: 'IBM Plex Mono', monospace; font-size: 0.85rem; color: #0D5C4B; font-weight: 500;\">Express + TypeScript\u003C/div>\n  \u003C/div>\n  \u003Cdiv style=\"padding: 1rem; background: #F5F2ED; border: 1px solid #2D3D3F;\">\n    \u003Cdiv style=\"font-family: 'IBM Plex Mono', monospace; font-size: 0.65rem; color: #5A5A5A; letter-spacing: 0.15em; margin-bottom: 0.25rem;\">MCP SDK\u003C/div>\n    \u003Cdiv style=\"font-family: 'IBM Plex Mono', monospace; font-size: 0.85rem; color: #0D5C4B; font-weight: 500;\">@modelcontextprotocol/sdk\u003C/div>\n  \u003C/div>\n  \u003Cdiv style=\"padding: 1rem; background: #F5F2ED; border: 1px solid #2D3D3F;\">\n    \u003Cdiv style=\"font-family: 'IBM Plex Mono', monospace; font-size: 0.65rem; color: #5A5A5A; letter-spacing: 0.15em; margin-bottom: 0.25rem;\">LLM\u003C/div>\n    \u003Cdiv style=\"font-family: 'IBM Plex Mono', monospace; font-size: 0.85rem; color: #0D5C4B; font-weight: 500;\">Claude Sonnet 4\u003C/div>\n  \u003C/div>\n  \u003Cdiv style=\"padding: 1rem; background: #F5F2ED; border: 1px solid #2D3D3F;\">\n    \u003Cdiv style=\"font-family: 'IBM Plex Mono', monospace; font-size: 0.65rem; color: #5A5A5A; letter-spacing: 0.15em; margin-bottom: 0.25rem;\">ESTILO\u003C/div>\n    \u003Cdiv style=\"font-family: 'IBM Plex Mono', monospace; font-size: 0.85rem; color: #0D5C4B; font-weight: 500;\">Tailwind CSS\u003C/div>\n  \u003C/div>\n  \u003Cdiv style=\"padding: 1rem; background: #F5F2ED; border: 1px solid #2D3D3F;\">\n    \u003Cdiv style=\"font-family: 'IBM Plex Mono', monospace; font-size: 0.65rem; color: #5A5A5A; letter-spacing: 0.15em; margin-bottom: 0.25rem;\">ÍCONES\u003C/div>\n    \u003Cdiv style=\"font-family: 'IBM Plex Mono', monospace; font-size: 0.85rem; color: #0D5C4B; font-weight: 500;\">Lucide Icons\u003C/div>\n  \u003C/div>\n\u003C/div>\n\n### Demo: Um Prompt, Quatro Ferramentas\n\nAqui está o TrampoAI em ação.

Chamou o **MCP do Gmail** para ler meus emails\n2. Resumiu e filtrou quais precisavam de ação\n3. Chamou o **MCP do Notion** para criar tarefas\n4. Chamou o **MCP do Google Calendar** para bloquear horário\n\nSem orquestração manual. Sem workflows hardcoded. O LLM descobriu quais ferramentas usar e em que ordem.\n\nEsta é a diferença entre IA que *informa* e IA que *age*. Eu não pedi informação. Pedi ação. E porque a IA tinha contexto sobre meu email, meu calendário e meu sistema de gestão de tarefas, ela realmente conseguiu entregar.\n\n## O Problema de Escala: MCP Mess\n\nOk, funciona. Mas o que acontece quando você tem **10 MCP Servers**? **50**? **100**?\n\n\u003CBeforeAfterCompare\n  before={{\n    title: \"MCP Ingênuo\",\n    description: \"Cada cliente se conecta a cada MCP Server\",\n    items: [\n      \"N clientes × M servidores = N×M conexões\",\n      \"Cada cliente gerencia suas próprias credenciais\",\n      \"Sem controle de acesso centralizado\",\n      \"Sem observabilidade unificada\"\n    ]\n  }}\n  after={{\n    title: \"O Problema\",\n    description: \"Isso não escala\",\n    items: [\n      \"Explosão de conexões\",\n      \"Credenciais espalhadas\",\n      \"Quem acessou o quê?\",\n      \"Quanto estamos gastando?\"\n    ]\n  }}\n/>\n\nConstruindo o TrampoAI, percebi na prática: **gerenciar múltiplos MCP Servers é um pesadelo**.\n\nCada servidor tem sua própria conexão, suas próprias ferramentas, suas próprias credenciais. Não há como saber quem executou o quê, quanto custou, se alguém está abusando do sistema.\n\n## A Solução: MCP Mesh\n\nÉ aqui que o [MCP Mesh da Deco](https://www.decocms.com/mesh) entra.\n\nA ideia é simples: em vez de cada cliente se conectar diretamente a cada MCP Server, você tem um **plano de controle** no meio.\n\nE honestamente? Configurar foi **ridiculamente fácil**. Rodei o projeto Deco localmente, abri a loja de MCPs deles, cliquei para autenticar os MCPs que queria (Gmail, Notion, Calendário), selecionei as ferramentas que precisava, e exportei tudo como um único link — esse é o mesh. Aquela URL é o que usei no TrampoAI. Sem configuração manual para cada servidor. Sem malabarismo de credenciais. Apenas clique, autentique, exporte. Pronto.\n\n\u003CInteractiveDiagram \n  title=\"Arquitetura MCP Mesh\"\n  nodes={[\n    { id: \"clients\", label: \"Clientes\", icon: \"💻\" },\n    { id: \"mesh\", label: \"MCP Mesh\", icon: \"🔀\" },\n    { id: \"servers\", label: \"MCP Servers\", icon: \"⚙️\" }\n  ]}\n/>\n\nO MCP Mesh fornece:\n\n### 1. Um Endpoint para Tudo\n\nNão importa quantos MCP Servers você tem. Seus clientes se conectam a **um único endpoint**. O Mesh roteia para as ferramentas certas.\n\n### 2. RBAC e Políticas\n\nControle de acesso no nível do plano de controle. Quem pode usar qual ferramenta? Precisa de aprovação para executar? Tudo configurável.\n\n### 3. Observabilidade\n\nLogs unificados para todas as execuções. Latência, erros, custos — tudo em um lugar.\n\n### 4. Roteamento Inteligente\n\nQuando você tem muitas ferramentas, enviar todas para o LLM fica caro (tokens) e lento. O Mesh tem estratégias de seleção inteligentes.\n\n### 5. Sem Vendor Lock-in\n\nOpen-source, self-hosted. Roda no seu Kubernetes, na sua infraestrutura. Você está no controle.\n\n```bash\n# Rode localmente em 1 minuto\nnpx @decocms/mesh\n```\n\nTrabalho na Deco, então sou obviamente enviesado. Mas genuinamente acredito que essa é a direção que as coisas estão indo. Conforme a adoção do MCP cresce, a necessidade de infraestrutura adequada para gerenciá-lo se torna crítica — assim como APIs precisavam de \u003CTooltip client:load content=\"Um API Gateway é um servidor que atua como ponto único de entrada para múltiplos serviços backend, lidando com autenticação, rate limiting e roteamento.\">API gateways\u003C/Tooltip>, o MCP precisa de sua própria camada de gerenciamento.\n\n## Um Vislumbre do Futuro\n\nDeixa eu compartilhar algo em que tenho pensado muito.\n\nImagino um futuro onde todos têm seu próprio mesh MCP pessoal — uma rede de conexões com todos os seus contextos, suas informações, suas ferramentas, sua vida. E junto com ele, seu próprio agente de IA. Não um produto que você usa. Um companheiro que *conhece você*.\n\nPense nisso: você está andando por aí, conversando com sua IA sobre uma ideia que acabou de ter. Você diz para ela salvar uma nota. Você pergunta sobre aquela mensagem que seu amigo mandou ontem. Você pensa em voz alta como sua semana está, e ela simplesmente *te conta* — porque ela sabe. Ela tem acesso a tudo que você deu permissão para ela ver.\n\nSeus emails, seu calendário, suas notas, suas mensagens, seus documentos, suas fotos, sua música, suas finanças — tudo conectado, tudo contextual, tudo *seu*.\n\nIsso não é ficção científica. As peças já estão aqui. MCP é o protocolo. O mesh é a infraestrutura. Os agentes estão ficando mais inteligentes a cada dia. O que falta é apenas tempo — e adoção.\n\nRealmente acredito que estamos caminhando para um mundo onde sua IA não é apenas uma ferramenta que você abre quando precisa de algo. Ela está sempre lá, sempre ciente do seu contexto, sempre pronta para ajudar. Como ter um amigo brilhante que nunca esquece nada e está genuinamente tentando tornar sua vida mais fácil.\n\nEsse é o futuro que me empolga. E honestamente? Estamos mais perto do que a maioria das pessoas pensa.\n\n## O Que Aprendi\n\nConstruir o TrampoAI foi prova real de como as coisas funcionam por baixo dos panos.\n\n\u003CFlowTimeline\n  title=\"Principais Aprendizados\"\n  steps={[\n    { \n      title: \"MCP é simples\", \n      description: \"O protocolo em si é elegante.

Simples assim.\",\n      icon: \"🔀\"\n    }\n  ]}\n/>\n\n## Conclusão\n\nAqui está minha visão: o próximo salto na utilidade da IA não virá de modelos maiores ou treinamento melhor. Virá de contexto melhor.\n\nUm modelo com conhecimento perfeito e zero contexto sobre sua vida é menos útil que um modelo menor que sabe exatamente em que você está trabalhando, o que precisa fazer e que ferramentas tem disponíveis.\n\nEstamos saindo de \"IA como oráculo\" para \"IA como assistente.\" Um oráculo responde perguntas. Um assistente conhece seu mundo e age dentro dele.\n\n**Sua IA é tão útil quanto o contexto que você dá a ela.**\n\n---\n\nSe você quer entender como isso funciona na prática, confira o [TrampoAI](https://github.com/viniciusventura29/TrampoAI). É open-source e você pode rodar localmente em 5 minutos.\n\nE se você quer explorar IA contextual por conta própria, comece pequeno. Escolha uma ferramenta que você usa diariamente — talvez seu calendário ou app de notas — e encontre um servidor MCP para ela. Conecte ao seu cliente de IA e veja o que se torna possível.\n\nA mudança de IA genérica para contextual não está vindo. Ela já está aqui.\n\nMe conta o que você acha nas minhas redes. Adoraria ouvir como você está usando IA contextual nos seus workflows!","src/content/blog/pt/contextIsKing.mdx","39499c4cd3d633f8","pt/contextIsKing.mdx","pt/purpose",{"id":185,"data":187,"body":190,"filePath":191,"digest":192,"legacyId":193,"deferredRender":48},{"title":188,"description":189,"publishDate":104,"image":105,"time":94,"draft":19,"translationKey":106},"Quem escreve o roteiro da sua vida?","Eu seguia um manual que não era meu. Até uma pergunta simples me forçar a confrontar isso.","import Quote from '../../../components/mdx/Quote.astro';\n\nVocê já sentiu que algo estava faltando, mesmo quando tudo parecia estar dando certo?\n\nEu senti. Por muito tempo.\n\nTrabalhava no Mercado Livre — uma multinacional bilionária, empresa gigante, estruturada, cheia de oportunidades. Era muito bom. Tinha um mundo pra conhecer, pra aprender. Ótimo salário. Família. Tudo.\n\nMas sempre tinha algo faltando dentro de mim.\n\nEu tinha baixa motivação pra trabalhar. Não era que o trabalho fosse ruim — era que eu não me sentia completo. Como se eu estivesse fazendo a coisa certa, mas não a *minha* coisa.\n\nE aí vinha a culpa: como eu poderia estar triste? Por que eu estaria insatisfeito? Na minha cabeça, eu não poderia reclamar da minha vida porque tinha pessoas em situações muito piores que a minha.\n\nPassei muitas noites mal dormidas nessa fase. Entrava num loop. E a terapia me ajudou a entender que essa lógica é uma armadilha — o fato de existirem pessoas em situações piores não invalida o que você sente. Seu incômodo é real. Sua insatisfação é válida. Ignorar isso só te afunda mais.\n\n---\n\nFoi nesse contexto que recebi uma proposta da Deco.\n\nFizemos umas 4 ou 5 reuniões até eu decidir aceitar. E na primeira, eles me fizeram uma pergunta que me pegou completamente desprevenido:\n\n> **\"O que você quer da sua vida?\"**\n\nUma pergunta tão simples. Tão direta. E tão difícil de responder.\n\nMas eu sabia. E sei. **Quero construir algo foda.** Não algo genérico. Não algo só pra pagar as contas. Algo que eu olhe e me enxergue. \"Eu estou aqui.\" Como se eu pertencesse àquele lugar.\n\n---\n\nEssa pergunta me forçou a confrontar algo que eu vinha evitando: quem define o que eu deveria querer? De onde vem esse roteiro de vida que eu estava seguindo sem questionar?\n\nNietzsche tem uma frase que sempre me fez pensar:\n\n\u003CQuote \n  text=\"Deus está morto. Deus permanece morto. E nós o matamos.\"\n/>\n\nNão é um statement religioso — e eu não quero entrar nessa discussão. O que Nietzsche estava apontando é algo mais profundo: os valores absolutos, aquelas verdades inquestionáveis que guiavam a sociedade, perderam sua força. E isso deixou um vazio.\n\nMas com esse vazio vem uma responsabilidade. Se não existe mais um guia pré-definido dizendo o que é certo, o que é errado, qual é o sentido da vida... então cabe a *você* criar isso.\n\nNietzsche não celebrava essa \"morte\". Ele alertava para o desafio imenso que é construir novos propósitos sem um roteiro pronto. É muito mais fácil seguir um manual. Fazer o que todo mundo faz. Aceitar os valores que te entregam prontos.\n\nMas também é libertador. Porque se você é responsável por criar seu sentido... então você pode criar um sentido que realmente faça sentido *pra você*.\n\n---\n\nE foi exatamente isso que eu fiz. Parei de aceitar verdades prontas.\n\nEu escutava muito na minha bolha falas como \"tem que trabalhar bastante enquanto é novo para ter liberdade financeira quando mais velho e poder fazer o que quer\". E por muito tempo eu aceitei isso como verdade.\n\nAté que um dia me perguntei: **mas por que eu não posso fazer o que eu quero agora? Por que eu tenho que ficar velho pra isso?**\n\nA partir disso, pensei: \"O que eu faria se eu fosse um velho super rico?\" E eu quero ir para esse lugar. Agora. Não daqui a 30 anos.\n\n\u003CQuote \n  text=\"Se você não está fazendo hoje o que faria como um velho super rico, talvez seja hora de repensar suas escolhas.\"\n  highlight={true}\n/>\n\nFelizmente, acho que já estou onde gostaria de estar. Se eu não estivesse fazendo o que faço atualmente, estaria muito perto disso. Esse exercício mental me ajuda a calibrar se estou no caminho certo.\n\n---\n\nPor muito tempo, eu calei desejos meus. Por medo. Por insegurança. Medo de ser julgado. Medo de não ser apoiado.\n\nEssa mudança de trabalho foi um desses casos. E ao fazer isso — ao finalmente escolher o que fazia sentido pra mim — algo mudou dentro de mim. Cada vez mais coisas surgem. Vontade de publicar mais o que eu penso e sou. Me expor mais ao mundo. Me conectar com mais pessoas. Conversar. Discutir. Me expor ao erro. Errar e aprender. Refazer.\n\nAcho que isso é um dos meus princípios e propósitos de vida:\n\n\u003CQuote \n  text=\"Viver.\"\n  highlight={true}\n/>\n\nSimplesmente viver. Fazer. Experimentar. Errar. Corrigir. Seguir.\n\n---\n\nAqui está o que eu aprendi: se seu trabalho se alinha com seu propósito de vida, a motivação vira uma arma poderosa de sucesso. Quando você tem tesão, vontade de fazer o que faz, as coisas caminham muito melhor. Sua produtividade é melhor. A qualidade da sua entrega é melhor. Sua satisfação é melhor. Sua vida é melhor. Porque você faz o que faz sentido pra você.\n\nHoje eu tenho esse privilégio de trabalhar com o que gosto. E digo privilégio porque, infelizmente, é exatamente isso — um privilégio. Queria que todos pudessem trabalhar com o que sentem tesão. Isso com certeza faria o mundo muito melhor. Mas nossa realidade é dura e cruel. Nem todo mundo tem essa escolha.\n\nDesse jeito, eu acredito que não tem como dar errado. Sei que no futuro não vou me arrepender — porque estou escolhendo conscientemente e diariamente viver a vida que eu quero viver.\n\n---\n\nSe você está em um lugar onde tudo parece certo mas algo parece errado — presta atenção nisso. Esse desconforto é informação.\n\nPropósito não é algo que você encontra pronto. É algo que você constrói. E às vezes, a resposta vem de lugares inesperados. Uma pergunta em uma entrevista. Uma conversa com alguém que pensa diferente. Um desconforto que você finalmente decide parar de ignorar.\n\nHoje eu acordo com vontade de trabalhar. Não todos os dias — sejamos honestos. Mas na maioria deles. E isso, pra mim, mudou tudo.\n\nEu não sou um guru. Não sou detentor de nenhuma sabedoria especial. Sou só um cara de 21 anos que passou por isso, viveu na pele, e tirou essas reflexões. Talvez daqui a 10 anos eu olhe pra esse texto e discorde de tudo. Mas é isso que eu penso hoje — e achei que valia compartilhar.\n\nSe você tá nessa jornada de buscar propósito, boa sorte. É uma jornada que vale a pena.\n\nE se quiser trocar uma ideia, me chama nas redes. Adoro conversar sobre essas coisas.","src/content/blog/pt/purpose.mdx","8b54f42e3a73f976","pt/purpose.mdx"]
