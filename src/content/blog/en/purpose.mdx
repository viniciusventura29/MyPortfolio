import Quote from '../../../components/mdx/Quote.astro';

Have you ever felt like something was missing, even when everything seemed to be going right?

I did. For a long time.

I worked at Mercado Livre — a billion-dollar multinational, huge company, well-structured, full of opportunities. It was great. There was a world to discover, to learn. Good salary. Family. Everything.

But something was always missing inside me.

I had low motivation to work. It wasn't that the job was bad — it was that I didn't feel complete. Like I was doing the right thing, but not *my* thing.

And then came the guilt: how could I be sad? Why would I be unsatisfied? In my head, I couldn't complain about my life because there were people in much worse situations than mine.

I went through many sleepless nights during this phase. I would fall into a loop. And therapy helped me understand that this logic is a trap — the fact that there are people in worse situations doesn't invalidate what you feel. Your discomfort is real. Your dissatisfaction is valid. Ignoring it only sinks you deeper.

It was in this context that I received an offer from Deco.

We had about 4 or 5 meetings before I decided to accept. And in the first one, they asked me a question that caught me completely off guard:

> **"What do you want from your life?"**

Such a simple question. So direct. And so hard to answer.

But I knew. And I still know. **I want to build something amazing.** Not something generic. Not something just to pay the bills. Something I can look at and see myself in. "I am here." As if I belonged to that place.

---

That question forced me to confront something I had been avoiding: who defines what I should want? Where does this life script I was following without questioning come from?

Nietzsche has a phrase that always made me think:

<Quote 
  text="God is dead. God remains dead. And we have killed him."
/>

This isn't a religious statement — and I don't want to get into that discussion. What Nietzsche was pointing to is something deeper: absolute values, those unquestionable truths that guided society, have lost their power. And that left a void.

But with that void comes responsibility. If there's no longer a pre-defined guide telling you what's right, what's wrong, what the meaning of life is... then it's up to *you* to create it.

Nietzsche wasn't celebrating this "death." He was warning about the immense challenge of building new purposes without a ready-made script. It's much easier to follow a manual. Do what everyone else does. Accept the values handed to you ready-made.

But it's also liberating. Because if you're responsible for creating your meaning... then you can create a meaning that actually makes sense *to you*.

---

And that's exactly what I did. I stopped accepting ready-made truths.

I used to hear a lot in my bubble things like "you have to work hard while you're young to have financial freedom when you're older and be able to do what you want." And for a long time I accepted this as truth.

Until one day I asked myself: **but why can't I do what I want now? Why do I have to be old for that?**

From that, I thought: "What would I do if I were a super rich old man?" And I want to go to that place. Now. Not 30 years from now.

<Quote 
  text="If you're not doing today what you would do as a super rich old person, maybe it's time to rethink your choices."

Fortunately, I think I'm already where I'd like to be. If I weren't doing what I currently do, I'd be very close to it. This mental exercise helps me calibrate whether I'm on the right path.

For a long time, I silenced my desires. Out of fear. Out of insecurity. Fear of being judged. Fear of not being supported.

This job change was one of those cases. And by doing it — by finally choosing what made sense to me — something changed inside me. More and more things are emerging. The desire to publish more of what I think and am. To expose myself more to the world. To connect with more people. To talk. To discuss. To expose myself to error. To err and learn. To redo.

I think this is one of my principles and life purposes:

<Quote 
  text="To live."
  highlight={true}

Simply live. Do. Experiment. Fail. Correct. Move on.

Here's what I learned: if your work aligns with your life's purpose, motivation becomes a powerful weapon for success. When you have passion, the drive to do what you do, things flow much better. Your productivity is better. The quality of your delivery is better. Your satisfaction is better. Your life is better. Because you do what makes sense to you.

Today I have the privilege of working with what I love. And I say privilege because, unfortunately, that's exactly what it is — a privilege. I wish everyone could work with what excites them. That would certainly make the world much better. But our reality is harsh and cruel. Not everyone has that choice.

This way, I believe there's no way to go wrong. I know that in the future I won't regret it — because I'm consciously and daily choosing to live the life I want to live.

If you're in a place where everything seems right but something feels wrong — pay attention to that. That discomfort is information.

Purpose isn't something you find ready-made. It's something you build. And sometimes, the answer comes from unexpected places. A question in an interview. A conversation with someone who thinks differently. A discomfort you finally decide to stop ignoring.

Today I wake up wanting to work. Not every day — let's be honest. But most of them. And that, for me, changed everything.

I'm not a guru. I don't hold any special wisdom. I'm just a 21-year-old who went through this, lived it firsthand, and drew these reflections. Maybe in 10 years I'll look at this text and disagree with everything. But this is what I think today — and I thought it was worth sharing.

If you're on this journey of seeking purpose, good luck. It's a journey worth taking.

And if you want to chat, hit me up on socials. I love talking about these things.
