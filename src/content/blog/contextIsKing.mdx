Are you still using AI like a smarter Google? Asking questions and hoping for useful answers?

I was too. And I was missing the point.

## The Problem: AI Without Context

Let me be honest: <Tooltip client:load content="Large Language Models - AI systems trained on massive amounts of text data to understand and generate human-like text">ChatGPT, Claude, and other LLMs</Tooltip> are incredible. They can write code, explain complex topics, and help you think through problems. But there's a fundamental limitation that most people don't think about.

**They know nothing about you.**

They don't know about your work. They don't know what meetings you have scheduled. They don't know what tasks are piling up on your to-do list. They don't know the codebase you're working on or the documents your team shares. They don't know about you.


## The Shift: Context is King

Here's what I've learned: the new way to use AI isn't about crafting better <Tooltip client:load content="Prompts are the instructions or questions you give to an AI. Prompt engineering is the practice of designing these instructions to get better outputs.">prompts</Tooltip> or learning magic techniques. It's about giving AI access to your world.

When AI has context about your environment — your emails, your calendar, your documents, your tools — something magical happens. It stops just *answering* and starts *acting*.

Instead of asking "How should I organize my emails?" you can say "Analyze my emails from today, summarize the important ones, and create tasks for anything that requires action."

And it just... does it.

<BeforeAfterCompare 
  before={{
    title: "AI Without Context",
    description: "Generic answers that apply to anyone",
    items: [
      "Copy-paste information manually",
      "Adapt generic answers to your situation",
      "Do the actual work yourself",
      "AI as 'fancy autocomplete'"
    ]
  }}
  after={{
    title: "AI With Context",
    description: "Personalized actions based on your world",
    items: [
      "AI understands your environment",
      "Receives specific, actionable responses",
      "Automates real tasks end-to-end",
      "AI as true assistant"
    ]
  }}
/>

## MCP: The Protocol Making This Possible

If you haven't heard about <Tooltip client:load content="Model Context Protocol - An open standard created by Anthropic that allows AI models to connect to external tools and data sources through a universal interface.">MCP (Model Context Protocol)</Tooltip>, it's worth understanding. In simple terms, MCP is a standard way to connect AI models to external tools and data sources.

In practice:
- **Connect Gmail** → AI can read, search, summarize, and send your emails
- **Connect Calendar** → AI can check availability, schedule meetings, and block time
- **Connect Notion** → AI can create pages, update databases, and organize your notes
- **Connect GitHub** → AI can review PRs, create issues, and check build status


Think of it as a universal adapter. Instead of building custom integrations for every AI tool, MCP provides a common language. Any MCP-compatible client (like <Tooltip client:load content="Cursor is an AI-powered code editor that integrates AI directly into the development workflow. Claude Desktop is Anthropic's official desktop application for interacting with Claude.">Cursor, Claude Desktop</Tooltip>, or custom agents) can connect to any MCP server and use its capabilities.

> If you want to dive deeper into MCP, check out the [official documentation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) and the [Anthropic announcement](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol).

The beauty of MCP is that it's open. Anyone can create an MCP server for their tool, and suddenly that tool becomes available to any AI that speaks MCP.

## My Setup: From Theory to Practice

Let me share a real example from my own workflow.

I connected three services through MCP:

<NetworkMesh 
  title="My Connected Services"
  user={{ label: "You", icon: "👤" }}
  agent={{ label: "AI Agent", icon: "🤖" }}
  gateway={{ label: "MCP Gateway", icon: "🔗" }}
  mcps={[
    { id: "gmail", label: "Gmail", icon: "📧" },
    { id: "notion", label: "Notion", icon: "📝" },
    { id: "calendar", label: "Calendar", icon: "📅" }
  ]}
/>

Then I asked the AI something like this:

> "Look at the emails I received today. Summarize what's important. Find any emails that require action or a decision from me, create tasks for them in Notion, and then block some time on my calendar for me to handle these tasks."

<FlowTimeline 
  title="What Actually Happens"
  steps={[
    { 
      title: "Email Analysis", 
      description: "AI scans today's inbox and identifies important messages",
      icon: "📬"
    },
    { 
      title: "Smart Summarization", 
      description: "Creates concise summaries with action items highlighted",
      icon: "📋"
    },
    { 
      title: "Task Creation", 
      description: "Automatically creates tasks in Notion for each action item",
      icon: "✅"
    },
    { 
      title: "Calendar Blocking", 
      description: "Finds available time slots and blocks them for task completion",
      icon: "⏰"
    }
  ]}
/>

And it worked. Not as a demonstration or a proof of concept — as an actual workflow I now use.

But it doesn't stop at actions. I can also *ask* about anything in that context. "What was that email from last week about the project deadline?" or "Do I have any conflicts next Tuesday?" — the AI searches through my connected services and gives me answers based on my actual data, not generic responses.

This is the difference between AI that *informs* and AI that *acts*. I didn't ask for information. I asked for action. And because the AI had context about my email, my calendar, and my task management system, it could actually deliver.

And here's the thing: you don't lose the ability to just *ask questions*. You still can — but now you get sharper, more accurate answers because the AI actually knows your context. You're not replacing anything. You're gaining actions *on top of* better-informed responses.

## Going Further: The Possibilities

Once you understand this paradigm, the possibilities explode.

### Communication Integration

Connect <Tooltip client:load content="Popular team communication platforms used in workplaces for real-time messaging and collaboration.">Slack and Teams</Tooltip> to your AI. Now it can analyze messages across all your communication channels, not just email. Imagine asking: "Summarize everything that happened in my work channels while I was in meetings."

### Development Workflow

Connect GitHub or <Tooltip client:load content="Jira is a project management tool by Atlassian commonly used for bug tracking, issue tracking, and agile project management.">Jira</Tooltip>. When someone assigns an issue to you, the AI can automatically create a task and notify you. Or ask it to review the PRs waiting for your review and draft responses based on the code changes.

### Personal Productivity

Connect your banking app for weekly spending summaries. Connect Spotify to create focus playlists based on your calendar blocks. The possibilities are endless.

The pattern is always the same: give AI context, and it becomes exponentially more useful.

## Managing the Complexity: MCP Mesh

As you connect more and more services, things can get messy. How do you manage authentication for ten different MCP servers? How do you control which AI agents can access which tools? How do you track what's being called and why?

This is where solutions like [deco's MCP Mesh](https://www.decocms.com/mesh) come in. Instead of wiring every client to every MCP server, a mesh provides a single control plane. One endpoint, centralized authentication, access policies, and observability across all your MCP traffic.

I work at deco, so I'm obviously biased. But I genuinely believe this is the direction things are going. As MCP adoption grows, the need for proper infrastructure to manage it becomes critical — just like how APIs needed <Tooltip client:load content="An API Gateway is a server that acts as a single entry point for multiple backend services, handling authentication, rate limiting, and routing.">API gateways</Tooltip>, MCP needs its own management layer.

## A Glimpse of the Future

Let me share something I've been thinking about a lot.

I imagine a future where everyone has their own personal MCP mesh — a web of connections to all your contexts, your information, your tools, your life. And alongside it, your own AI agent. Not a product you use. A companion that *knows you*.

Think about it: you're walking around, talking to your AI about an idea you just had. You tell it to save a note. You ask about that message your friend sent yesterday. You wonder out loud what your week looks like, and it just *tells you* — because it knows. It has access to everything you've given it permission to see.

Your emails, your calendar, your notes, your messages, your documents, your photos, your music, your finances — all connected, all contextual, all *yours*.

This isn't science fiction. The pieces are already here. MCP is the protocol. The mesh is the infrastructure. The agents are getting smarter every day. What's missing is just time — and adoption.

I truly believe we're heading toward a world where your AI isn't just a tool you open when you need something. It's always there, always aware of your context, always ready to help. Like having a brilliant friend who never forgets anything and is genuinely trying to make your life easier.

That's the future I'm excited about. And honestly? We're closer than most people think.

## Conclusion: The Future is Contextual

Here's my take: the next leap in AI usefulness won't come from bigger models or better training. It will come from better context.

A model with perfect knowledge and zero context about your life is less useful than a smaller model that knows exactly what you're working on, what you need to do, and what tools you have available.

We're moving from "AI as oracle" to "AI as assistant." An oracle answers questions. An assistant knows your world and acts within it.

**Your AI is only as useful as the context you give it.**

If you want to explore this yourself, start small. Pick one tool you use daily — maybe your calendar or your notes app — and find an MCP server for it. Connect it to your AI client and see what becomes possible.

The shift from generic to contextual AI isn't coming. It's already here.

Let me know what you think about this on my socials. I'd love to hear how you're using contextual AI in your workflows!
