A *Real Developer*... It's could sounds stranges but I will explain what I mean. I try to do my best in everyway, including my professional life so I always gets me thinking, what difference between good devs to others devs? What makes me a developer? What I have to do to be a good dev?

Before I start is important to know that everything that I will write here is not what you have to be but what I think is important to have in mind or where drive your effort to.

# good code reader

In my conception, one of the first topics that we must to have in mind to be a good dev is to be a good code reader, have the habit to read 
others developers code. It's very important because when you read someone else code you see new ways to code, develop your critical eye, 
improve your understandability about programming, improve your criativity and keeps your mind always opened.

You could do this contribuiting in open sources projects, what is other important topic that I'll talk more about it below

# Open source


<!-- 
WHAT IS 
- dev code reader
- open minded
- dev that participate of open source community

WHAT IS NOT
- frameworkers devs
- "The best language" dev/ java is slow dev
- hype dev

-->

<!-- Before we talk about what I concearn about what is a real developer,  I would like to explain what is **not** a real developer in my 
conception.

Nowadays, our lifes are accelerated, in every way! We have been teach to learn fast and work faster and delivery a solution even more faster, 
and that is dangerous way to walk through. Because walking in this path can create *"Frameworkers developers"*.

<details>
    <summary>Frameworkers developers</summary>
    A frameworker developer is that dev that only knows to write code in that framework don't understanding why that framework work like that and the worst, not even understanding the language that the framework uses.
</details>

From start, write code does not makes you a developer! There is a lot of other things that compose a dev.

Before you misunderstand me, I'm not meaning that you have to learn a lot of frameworks or that is wrong you focus in one framework, actually,
that is great! What I see as a problem is don't undestand how this framework works, why it is like it is and why use it.
